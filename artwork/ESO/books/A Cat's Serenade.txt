A Cat's Serenade

(A Khajiiti Love Song)

CHORUS
This one weaves a song
He'll sing it to you all day long
Will you love him? Will you love him?

He'll steal a thousand jewels
He'll even play the fool
Say you love him. Say you love him.

Well, your mother will never give her blessing, true
But let's be honest dear
That's what you want to hear

No, this one will never buy you Mara's ring
But under the starlight
You can grasp him tight

CHORUS
This one weaves a song
He'll sing it to you all day long
Will you love him? Will you love him?

So many sweetmeats this one could woo
But it's you that he needs
Oh, he begs and pleads

In the moonlight he will worship you
But come the morning sun
He will most definitely run!

CHORUS
This one weaves a song
He'll sing it to you all day long
Will you love him? Will you love him?
