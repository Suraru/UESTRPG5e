A Gold Coast Children's Bestiary

Goblin
Goblins from beyond the heath,
Wear necklaces of children's teeth!
Their arrows with the poison laced,
From nixad gutsâ€”ground into paste.

Minotaur
The minotaur are warriors born.
They hang dead children from their horns!
Don't think them cows; they never "moo."
The meat they most prefer is you!

Nixad
The nixad flit about like flies.
Their favorite meal is children's eyes!
These sugar fiends are cruel and vain.
They take delight in children's pain.

River Troll
Every child with half a mind,
Knows river trolls are most unkind.
Those who don't will soon endure,
Their childish minds in troll manure!
