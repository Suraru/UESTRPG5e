A Nereid Stole My Husband

A nereid stole my husband 
My husband a nereid stole
Beware the maids of the seastrand
Lest you be the next we console.

We strolled blithely along the shore
Gathering shells and turning stones
When came the voice I now deplore
A voice, a song, such soaring tones!

At once, my husband quickly sped
"Wait!" I cried, "'Tis a nereid!"
But faster still he pressed ahead
Her sweet call could not be gainsaid.

Too late, alas, alas, too late
I found him swaying, deep in thrall
My worst fear sent to me by fate
He followed the nereid's call.

And she, beautiful, cruel, and vain
Swam to her sisters, calling this back,
"Your husband was no prize to gain;
He's yours once more, Lady Crookback!"

A nereid stole my husband 
Returning him without delay
Poor me, near free from his demands
Stuck instead with him since that day!
