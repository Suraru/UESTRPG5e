A Threnody to Lost Love

Deep within my mind
The storms, they gather inside me
Deep within my mind
The tides rise far too high
Hiding in my mind
The sorrow whispers freely
Fear is so unkind
Shouting through my tears

Please don't find me
I can't be free
Please come find me
Your death haunts me
Your death haunts me

Deep within my soul
The fires burn inside of me
Deep within my soul
Pain rips through all I am
Lurking in my soul
Loneliness beseeches me
I'm no longer whole
Screaming through my tears

Please don't find me
I can't be free
Please come find me
Your death haunts me
Your death haunts me
Your death haunts me
