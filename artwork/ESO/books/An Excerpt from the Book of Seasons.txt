An Excerpt from the Book of Seasons

Of all of my reasons,
Spring is my first and favorite of seasons.
To see the blue water shine in the sun,
or the green trees inviting a climbâ€”oh, what fun!

The air is cool and I am without thought,
As I sleep on the rocks which aren't yet too hot.
And I wake to see endless fields of green grass,
Not faded pastures or a leaf-covered mass.

This is why Spring is my first and favorite of seasons.
Summer, Fall, and Winter? All have lesser reasons.
