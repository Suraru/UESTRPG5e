Appointments for the Thane

Thane Mera, here are your appointments for the day. I've kept them as nonspecific as possible, as you asked, and have left you as much time as could be afforded for you to go on your walks around the city. It isn't as much as you'd like for your patrols, but there are simply too many things that require your attention. And I wasn't able to make time for any Konunleikar activities. My apologies.
