Auridon Explored, Chapter III

Ahh, fair Errinorne Isle. A part of the Buraniim sea-complex during the time of the Ancients, and then long used as a shipping and warehouse complex by nearby Skywatch. Then came the Sload, disease, and death.

Even in the aftermath of Skywatch's defiance, Sload forces held the island for decades. When it was finally cleansed by a concerted force, a remnant of the All-Flags Navy, it was left to rot and decay. 

A shame, as its natural beauty is extreme, and its ruins ... magnificent.
