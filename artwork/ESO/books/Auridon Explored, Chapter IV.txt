Auridon Explored, Chapter IV

This island is fascinating. It was clearly once a hub for the ancient Aldmer, perhaps part of a larger structure that extended out into the sea. Now it's used most often as a retreat from the city life in nearby Skywatch.

I've found some evidence here that the resurgent Daedric cults, the Worm cultists, are making preparations to construct some kind of dolmen here. I'll have to warn the local authorities in Skywatch.
