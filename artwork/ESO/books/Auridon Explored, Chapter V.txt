Auridon Explored, Chapter V

Gentle reader, I feel the need to edit my unedited thoughts about the beautiful, unparalleled Isle of Contemplation. Without a doubt, one of the most beautiful places on Tamriel, your fair explorer has many happy memories of quiet meals ... meaningful looks ... moonlit encounters ...

As I said, my time on the Isle of Contemplation has been magical. I hope yours is the same.
