Auridon Explored, Chapter VII

The ruin known by locals as Hightide Keep was once a sprawling complex of defensive fortifications. A relic from the time of the Ancients, it was painstakingly maintained and manned.

As a result, Skywatch was able to put up an incredible defense during the Sload attack on the city. Powerful magical constructs were crafted and expended. Dozens of Sload warships were destroyed. 

The city finally fell when a Sload Warcaster filled his voluminous gullet with volatile alchemical reagents and threw himself at the base of the cliffs. The resulting explosion toppled much of the extended rock face, and plunged the ruins into the sea.
