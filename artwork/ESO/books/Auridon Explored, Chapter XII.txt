Auridon Explored, Chapter XII

I'm often asked when the Ancients first arrived in the Archipelago. My researches indicate that it was in the middle of the Early Merethic Period. 

The farthest northern tip of Auridon, now called Nine Prows Landing, is by tradition the first place within the Summerset Isles to feel the tread of the Ancients. From Summerset, the Ancients spread to the shores of Tamriel, settling almost every region of that great, contentious continent. There they built new societies, and found both glory and destruction.
