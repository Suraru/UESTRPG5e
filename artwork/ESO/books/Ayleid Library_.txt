Ayleid Library?

… began exploring this Ayleid ruin … massive bookcases line the walls in some areas. Unfortunately, the tomes crumble when we've attempted to remove them … saddens me to think of the knowledge lost to time.

… told Nael not to touch it, and now … strange sounds from the tombs … sounds like something is clawing nearby … see what we can collect before we leave … time … the dead have risen, and I can't find the exit.
