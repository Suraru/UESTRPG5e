Ballad of Dranoth Hleran

With fearsome claws, Skar did attack
Protected by his stone hard shell
That none could even dent or crack
By the beast's might our armies fell

But one brave hero held no fear
Dranoth Hleran, warrior brave
With Calderas, his mighty spear
But one resounding cry he gave

He raised his spear to the beast
He ran, evading every blow
His heart was set, his speed increased
As he charged the mighty foe

With a final thrust, a final clash
At last the mighty Skar was slain
With honor gifted to his House
May Hleran's glory never wane
