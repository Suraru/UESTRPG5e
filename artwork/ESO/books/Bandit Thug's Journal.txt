Bandit Thug's Journal

Those Orcs were two of a kind. Get this, each hired me to kill the other! So I took their gold, poisoned them both, and set their lodge on fire to make it look accidental.

Never killed an Orc chief's wife before. Today I killed two!

Saw <<1>> in <<2>> today—she's the Barkbite chief's third wife. I dropped hints she's in charge because of me, but nothing stuck. She doesn't have a foul bone in her body! Felt wrong to push her, so I wished her a good day. Must be getting soft.
