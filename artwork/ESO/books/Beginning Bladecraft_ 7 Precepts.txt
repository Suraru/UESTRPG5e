Beginning Bladecraft: 7 Precepts

By Master Ghelwezh

—	Do not strangle the grip—hold it firmly but lightly in your palm.

—	The blade curves: the edge is rigid, but the flat is flexible. Learn to feel your sword's range of motion.

—	Your sword is not the weapon, it is only the point of the weapon. Your entire body is the weapon, and it must move as one.

—	You expose yourself only when you attack—but if you do not attack, you cannot hit.

—	The strongest slash is with the forte of the blade.

—	Move always, defending with stop thrusts, parries, backsteps, and sidesteps. To stand still is to die.

—	Know your lunge range—and your opponent's. Learn to sense it without looking down.
