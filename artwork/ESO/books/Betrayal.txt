Betrayal

This place I built on solid rock,
It breaks, crumbles away,
Destroyed and shaken to the core,
Betrayed by Alanwe

My blindness was my love for her,
Though any fool could weigh,
Her will was weak, her lust unbound,
That strumpet, Alanwe

My heart betrayed, I took her soul,
Cracked it with vicious fray,
Eternal now will be her pain,
'Tis the fate of Alanwe
