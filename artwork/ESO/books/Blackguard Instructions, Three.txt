Blackguard Instructions, Three

I shall eagerly await your return at the ancient xanmeer. Gather the four meditation cylinders and bring them to me there. Remember, these Argonian antiquities are crucial to the ritual I need to perform. And when I begin the ritual, make sure that all of the Blackguards remain outside the chamber. Any distraction could disrupt the ritual and cause the curse to be prematurely released from Beela-Kaar's relic.

And that would be bad.
