Blood-Sealed Contract

Before the sight of Molag Bal, we seal this bargain between the Bloodthorn and the Hag Fen coven with fresh blood. 

In exchange for any undamaged women we capture in the conquest of Glenumbra, Mother Murk and her coven will oppose the Beldama Wyrd and keep them occupied. My servants shall deliver the women to the ruined tower in the bog, where they will be transformed and brought into the coven.

Should either party break this bargain, their lives shall be forfeit.
