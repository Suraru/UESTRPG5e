By Gentle Winds

|acThe Chosen Warrior accepts that in the pits of despair,
there is always a gentle wind to guide them.

But even with guidance, they must walk toward their destiny by their own will.
This is the fate of heroes.

The Chosen Warrior follows the path laid before them,
their heart strengthened by their certainty.

They become the light that guides all others along the chosen path.

Know this or you will not don the mask.
