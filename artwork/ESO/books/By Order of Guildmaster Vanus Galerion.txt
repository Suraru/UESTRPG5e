By Order of Guildmaster Vanus Galerion

By order of the Guildmaster, be welcome to the isle of Eyevea! All members of the guild in good standing are to view this isle as a refuge, a sanctuary for magical study and a neutral ground on Tamriel.

All members, be you warned:

— Alliance in-fighting will not be tolerated! The Three Banners War is in Cyrodiil. Here, all Mages are at peace and in harmony.

— Accept your fellows, no matter their appearance. All the thinking races of Tamriel practice the spellcasting arts. Intolerance towards a fellow guildmember is to be reported to the Guildmaster, and will be dealt with severely!

— Pay the tithe. Members in good standing are welcome to make use of the isle's sytem of portals for trade and transportation. Any member with a standing business must, however, pay a percentage fee to the guild in tithe.

The return of Eyevea marks a new era for the Guild!
