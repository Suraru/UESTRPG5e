Captain Izad's Letter

Stand atop Saintsport's star
And spy the eternal sentinel
Skirt its gate to reach the shrine
Northwest stands the warrior
Walk forty-five paces south
Leftward palms frame the sight
Of the island of iron faces
Follow the rocky finger
Through the broken ship
Find the stone ship at anchor
Riches lie under leaves in its port
