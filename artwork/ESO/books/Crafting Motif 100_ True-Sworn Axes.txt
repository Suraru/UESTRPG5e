Crafting Motif 100: True-Sworn Axes

By Cassia Hiriel, Outfitter and Artisan

Ours is a simple task: Pyroturge Encratis requests attire that will allow our agents to infiltrate and destroy their target. As you may expect, the Pyroturge's preferred method for eradicating evidence of True-Sworn presence will consist of burning down the entire villa. To that end, I have designed armor that will protect against the raging inferno that will result. You will also find plans for new weapons among my designs. The item we seek holds great value and we must be the only ones to obtain it. Arming ourselves properly ensures this outcome and advance our timeline.

AXES

As the fires rage and consume the villa, you may encounter falling debris that blocks your escape. The thick iron and strong bronze that form the axes will cut through any timber to clear your path. The blade itself comes to a sharp point along the bottom edge, which shall also provide the ability to tear at armor.
