Crafting Motif 100: True-Sworn Boots

By Cassia Hiriel, Outfitter and Artisan

Ours is a simple task: Pyroturge Encratis requests attire that will allow our agents to infiltrate and destroy their target. As you may expect, the Pyroturge's preferred method for eradicating evidence of True-Sworn presence will consist of burning down the entire villa. To that end, I have designed armor that will protect against the raging inferno that will result. You will also find plans for new weapons among my designs. The item we seek holds great value and we must be the only ones to obtain it. Arming ourselves properly ensures this outcome and advance our timeline.

BOOTS

Our agents will need speed to accomplish their mission, as well as stealth to evade the creatures within the villa. Each pair of boots provided are made from a thick guar leather that insulates against the heat. The soles use a lining of my own concoction that will not melt under the hottest conditions.
