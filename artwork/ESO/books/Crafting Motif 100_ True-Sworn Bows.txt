Crafting Motif 100: True-Sworn Bows

By Cassia Hiriel, Outfitter and Artisan

Ours is a simple task: Pyroturge Encratis requests attire that will allow our agents to infiltrate and destroy their target. As you may expect, the Pyroturge's preferred method for eradicating evidence of True-Sworn presence will consist of burning down the entire villa. To that end, I have designed armor that will protect against the raging inferno that will result. You will also find plans for new weapons among my designs. The item we seek holds great value and we must be the only ones to obtain it. Arming ourselves properly ensures this outcome and advance our timeline.

BOWS

Curved ash wood reinforced with steel on the grip offer flexibility and strength to the archer. Be cautious about the flames licking the wood. The quiver offers even more carrying capacity for your incendiary tonics, which should make flaming arrows especially easy.
