Crafting Motif 100: True-Sworn Staves

By Cassia Hiriel, Outfitter and Artisan

Ours is a simple task: Pyroturge Encratis requests attire that will allow our agents to infiltrate and destroy their target. As you may expect, the Pyroturge's preferred method for eradicating evidence of True-Sworn presence will consist of burning down the entire villa. To that end, I have designed armor that will protect against the raging inferno that will result. You will also find plans for new weapons among my designs. The item we seek holds great value and we must be the only ones to obtain it. Arming ourselves properly ensures this outcome and advance our timeline.

STAVES

While many staff-users prefer wood for their weapons, that would not work in this case for obvious reasons. Bronze-coated steel forms the core of each staff, notched along the center for a better grip. The head is pointed in almost a trident shape. This is pragmaticâ€”if the wielder needs move flaming material from their path, a forked design will assist in that.
