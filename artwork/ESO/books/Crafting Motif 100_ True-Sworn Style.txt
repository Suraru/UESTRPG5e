Crafting Motif 100: True-Sworn Style

By Cassia Hiriel, Outfitter and Artisan

Ours is a simple task: Pyroturge Encratis requests attire that will allow our agents to infiltrate and destroy their target. As you may expect, the Pyroturge's preferred method for eradicating evidence of True-Sworn presence will consist of burning down the entire villa. To that end, I have designed armor that will protect against the raging inferno that will result. You will also find plans for new weapons among my designs. The item we seek holds great value and we must be the only ones to obtain it. Arming ourselves properly ensures this outcome and advance our timeline.

AXES

As the fires rage and consume the villa, you may encounter falling debris that blocks your escape. The thick iron and strong bronze that form the axes will cut through any timber to clear your path. The blade itself comes to a sharp point along the bottom edge, which shall also provide the ability to tear at armor.

BELTS

Loose clothes in a blaze are obviously not ideal. No need to catch fire due to a flapping tunic. Cinch these hard leather belts tight to protect yourself. I have added carrier loops around the waist so you can attach incendiary tonics with ease.

BOOTS

Our agents will need speed to accomplish their mission, as well as stealth to evade the creatures within the villa. Each pair of boots provided are made from a thick guar leather that insulates against the heat. The soles use a lining of my own concoction that will not melt under the hottest conditions.

BOWS

Curved ash wood reinforced with steel on the grip offer flexibility and strength to the archer. Be cautious about the flames licking the wood. The quiver offers even more carrying capacity for your incendiary tonics, which should make flaming arrows especially easy.

CHEST PIECES

I chose a darker color scheme for this attire to increase our agents' capability for remaining hidden during the mission. The dark brown leather on the chest is highly flexible, even in the heavier versions. And the deep blue cloth at the joints increase movement. Thick cloth covers the chest and neck area to protect against cinders floating within the air.

DAGGERS

Simple yet noble was my goal for our weapon design; and even the treacherous daggers maintain this feel. The blades are etched with an elegant pattern of my own design. The hilt and guard are coated in bronze for strength.

GLOVES

Full-length gloves were imperative for this armor. If you have yet to experience the Pyroturge's art, then know that he excels at generating heat of amazing intensity. While our agents seek their target, we cannot expose their hands to the dangers of these flames.

HELMETS

I admit to my own cleverness in these designs. The guar leather masks cover the entire face for purposes of anonymity and protection. However, I have added lenses made of amber that filter the bright flames they will encounter. They limit peripheral vision somewhat, but the sacrifice should be worth it.

LEG GREAVES

Despite my warnings, our magic-using agents insist on loose clothing around their legs. This is tradition among their kind, so I accommodated as I could. The cloth is heavy and weighted down around the hem so as not to billow out. The more sensible leg armor uses supple leathers occasionally clad in dark steel.

MACES

I am partial to two-headed mace designs due to the balance. Additionally, in the heat of battle, having twice the options for damage improves survivability. Use the thickest steel we have for the head and handles. We cannot afford for these to snap under pressure.

SHIELDS

A classic design that I acquired from books given to me by our benefactor. I believe it originates from the First Era. Rounded shields with heavy riveted rims offer the best strength and protection while maintaining portability. We do not want to slow the agents in their task.

SHOULDER ARMOR

I chose leather pauldrons in most cases in order to stay as flexible as possible. We do not need to weigh down our people any more than necessary. The look of them stays understated. The True-Sworn need not show off their allegiances.

STAVES

While many staff-users prefer wood for their weapons, that would not work in this case for obvious reasons. Bronze-coated steel forms the core of each staff, notched along the center for a better grip. The head is pointed in almost a trident shape. This is pragmaticâ€”if the wielder needs move flaming material from their path, a forked design will assist in that.

SWORDS

Many sword designers of this era prefer ostentatious hand guard and blade designs. I find this foolish. A simple, strong weapon engenders as much fear as any eccentric appearance. That said, etch the blade carefully. I am told this symbol comes from out benefactor and should not be altered.
