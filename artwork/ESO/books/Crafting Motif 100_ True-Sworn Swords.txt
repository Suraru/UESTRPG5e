Crafting Motif 100: True-Sworn Swords

By Cassia Hiriel, Outfitter and Artisan

Ours is a simple task: Pyroturge Encratis requests attire that will allow our agents to infiltrate and destroy their target. As you may expect, the Pyroturge's preferred method for eradicating evidence of True-Sworn presence will consist of burning down the entire villa. To that end, I have designed armor that will protect against the raging inferno that will result. You will also find plans for new weapons among my designs. The item we seek holds great value and we must be the only ones to obtain it. Arming ourselves properly ensures this outcome and advance our timeline.

SWORDS

Many sword designers of this era prefer ostentatious hand guard and blade designs. I find this foolish. A simple, strong weapon engenders as much fear as any eccentric appearance. That said, etch the blade carefully. I am told this symbol comes from our benefactor and should not be altered.
