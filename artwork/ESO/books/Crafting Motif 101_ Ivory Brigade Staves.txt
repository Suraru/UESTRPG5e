Crafting Motif 101: Ivory Brigade Staves

By Captain Rian Liore
A guide to crafting armor and weapons in the Ivory Brigade style

Throughout history, the city of Leyawiin has been able to rely upon the protection of the Imperial Legion. Alas, those days appear to be over. With the collapse of Imperial authority and power, each province of the Empire has been left to look after itself. If we are to protect Leyawiin from the depredations of pirates or invasions by the warring alliances contending for the Ruby Throne, we must raise an army of our own—an army of the Blackwood—to deter aggression and keep the peace.

As the commander of Leyawiin's forces, the task of organizing this new army has fallen to me. I have always felt that the first step in making soldiers is to teach new recruits that they serve something greater than themselves, and to take pride in that service. To put on a uniform is to proclaim an allegiance and forge a bond of loyalty with those who wear that same uniform. At the same time, a prudent commander must consider the tools his soldiers will need to carry out their duties, and the resources available. To that end, I will now enumerate my expectations for the proper equipping of the army of Leyawiin.

For our coat of arms, I have selected an ivory horse on a field of green, the ancient symbol of Leyawiin. And from this brave device our army takes its name: the Ivory Brigade, defenders of the good folk of Blackwood.

STAVES
Priests and mages are an important adjunct to the fighting ranks of the Ivory Brigade, and it is important for our spellcasters to be as well-equipped as our footsoldiers. An Ivory Brigade staff is a light but strong brass rod with grips of forest-green leather. The head of the staff is a triangular steel crozier, simple and utilitarian.
