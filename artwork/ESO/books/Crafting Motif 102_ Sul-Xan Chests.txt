Crafting Motif 102: Sul-Xan Chests

By Professor Astinia Bincal, University of Gwylim, Anthropology Department

I feel no need to point out to my readers that scholars of Argonian cultural mores come by the bushel. The recent mania in our scholarly community to expose "dark secrets" of the beast race in the swamps has led to such trite revelations as "On Crunchy Bugs and Moist Spines- An Investigation into Gustatory Practices of Southern Argonians." However, during a recent sojourn through Blackwood, I encountered a tribe with a culture so distinct that I felt compelled to document it. After my entourage graciously cut down several of these Sul-Xan, I collected their effects. What follows are descriptions of the materials and methods of construction which appear unique to this group.

CHEST PIECES
No surprise that such a vicious people focus on defending sensitive vital body areas. Even the lighter armors have metal plating protecting the chest and gut. Every piece is also quite tight-fitting, so that nothing can be snagged during battle. Intricate scale plating underlies dark leather, providing extra protection.
