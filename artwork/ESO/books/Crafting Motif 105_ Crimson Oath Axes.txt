Crafting Motif 105: Crimson Oath Axes

By Disastrix Zkizskz

We are the oathsworn of the Red Father. The scarlet reavers of the Razor King. The bloodletters of the Fire-Veined God. We are the Crimson Oath! We offer endless death and destruction to Lord Dagon be it our enemy's or our own. When we take the field of battle, we vow one thing: blood will spill. Take your oath garb and drench it in the gore of our enemies. This is the greatest offering you can make to our Great Prince.

AXES
An axe serves no purpose but to cleave. It is made for destruction alone. It is the blessed weapon of Lord Dagon. A Crimson Oath axe must be rugged and sharp, for you will wield it until the blade is worn to a nub and every part of it is stained red.
