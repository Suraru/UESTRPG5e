Crafting Motif 105: Crimson Oath Boots

By Disastrix Zkizskz

We are the oathsworn of the Red Father. The scarlet reavers of the Razor King. The bloodletters of the Fire-Veined God. We are the Crimson Oath! We offer endless death and destruction to Lord Dagon be it our enemy's or our own. When we take the field of battle, we vow one thing: blood will spill. Take your oath garb and drench it in the gore of our enemies. This is the greatest offering you can make to our Great Prince.

BOOTS
Ironclad and spiked! Heavy enough to crack stone! Let them hear the Oath's march thunder far and wide like a coming storm! Drive your knees into the enemy's guts and trample their entrails! Kneel upon the neck of your conquered foes and let the spikes drink deep of their despair!
