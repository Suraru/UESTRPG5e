Crafting Motif 105: Crimson Oath Legs

By Disastrix Zkizskz

We are the oathsworn of the Red Father. The scarlet reavers of the Razor King. The bloodletters of the Fire-Veined God. We are the Crimson Oath! We offer endless death and destruction to Lord Dagon be it our enemy's or our own. When we take the field of battle, we vow one thing: blood will spill. Take your oath garb and drench it in the gore of our enemies. This is the greatest offering you can make to our Great Prince.

LEG GREAVES
Much like the girdles protect our guts, the skirts and leggings are key to keeping your legs and groin intact. Wounds to either will rarely kill us, but they'll leave you struggling to continue the fight while your fellows leap and stride over you for glory.
