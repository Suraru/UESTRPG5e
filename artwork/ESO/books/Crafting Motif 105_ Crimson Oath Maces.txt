Crafting Motif 105: Crimson Oath Maces

By Disastrix Zkizskz

We are the oathsworn of the Red Father. The scarlet reavers of the Razor King. The bloodletters of the Fire-Veined God. We are the Crimson Oath! We offer endless death and destruction to Lord Dagon be it our enemy's or our own. When we take the field of battle, we vow one thing: blood will spill. Take your oath garb and drench it in the gore of our enemies. This is the greatest offering you can make to our Great Prince.

MACES
Is there no more brutish weapon than the maul? It is the avalanche embodied! A simple weapon with one embellishment suggested by our tormentors. The mortals possess small hammers called tenderizers they use to pulverize meat for consumption. This is one of their rare, good inventions.
