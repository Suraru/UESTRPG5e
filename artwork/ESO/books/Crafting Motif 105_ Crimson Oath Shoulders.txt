Crafting Motif 105: Crimson Oath Shoulders

By Disastrix Zkizskz

We are the oathsworn of the Red Father. The scarlet reavers of the Razor King. The bloodletters of the Fire-Veined God. We are the Crimson Oath! We offer endless death and destruction to Lord Dagon be it our enemy's or our own. When we take the field of battle, we vow one thing: blood will spill. Take your oath garb and drench it in the gore of our enemies. This is the greatest offering you can make to our Great Prince.

SHOULDERS
Always strap at least one strong, sharp piece of metal to your shoulder. It can keep you from having your arm lopped off, but more importantly you can throw all your weight behind it and gore some fool who thought your only weapon was what you had in hand.
