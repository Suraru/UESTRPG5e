Crafting Motif 105: Crimson Oath Staves

By Disastrix Zkizskz

We are the oathsworn of the Red Father. The scarlet reavers of the Razor King. The bloodletters of the Fire-Veined God. We are the Crimson Oath! We offer endless death and destruction to Lord Dagon be it our enemy's or our own. When we take the field of battle, we vow one thing: blood will spill. Take your oath garb and drench it in the gore of our enemies. This is the greatest offering you can make to our Great Prince.

STAVES
Hurling fire and lightning is all well and good in the eyes of the Prince of Destruction, but when you've exhausted your limited power: what then? Well, what is a staff if not an overlong mace? A sturdy, pointy, bludgeon on the end of your precious stick will get some real blood on your hands.
