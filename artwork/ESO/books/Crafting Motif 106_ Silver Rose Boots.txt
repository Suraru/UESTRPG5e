Crafting Motif 106: Silver Rose Boots

By Chief Archivist Bartholomew

Like our namesake, the liveries of the venerable Knights of the Silver Rose have grown haler and more beautiful with each generation, tended by collective wisdom and guidance of our order. Here I record the essential elements of form and function in our arms and armaments as dictated by Prior Theirric Sarazen, Knight-Commander of the Silver Rose, 2E 579.

BOOTS

The Silver Rose prefers tall, slender boots made from supple leathers often found in the shops of Wayrest fine clothiers. Although less durable than dense hide or hardened leather, the flexibility of the material is second only to Elven gossamer. It also provides more comfort beneath plate mail on a long march.
