Crafting Motif 106: Silver Rose Chests

By Chief Archivist Bartholomew

Like our namesake, the liveries of the venerable Knights of the Silver Rose have grown haler and more beautiful with each generation, tended by collective wisdom and guidance of our order. Here I record the essential elements of form and function in our arms and armaments as dictated by Prior Theirric Sarazen, Knight-Commander of the Silver Rose, 2E 579.

CHEST PIECES

As a renowned and honored Knightly Order of High Rock, we emblazon our sacred rose proudly upon our doublets, jerkins, and tabards for all to see. It is the symbol of our nobility: regal, yet dangerous. The red, black, and silver of our uniforms and our banners are both a badge of our authority and a warning to our enemies as we cross the battlefield.
