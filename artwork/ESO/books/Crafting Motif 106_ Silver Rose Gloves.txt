Crafting Motif 106: Silver Rose Gloves

By Chief Archivist Bartholomew

Like our namesake, the liveries of the venerable Knights of the Silver Rose have grown haler and more beautiful with each generation, tended by collective wisdom and guidance of our order. Here I record the essential elements of form and function in our arms and armaments as dictated by Prior Theirric Sarazen, Knight-Commander of the Silver Rose, 2E 579.

GLOVES

While the construction of our gloves is not vastly different from other knightly orders, Silver Rose gauntlets are consecrated at the temples of all Eight Divines. These blessings are to safeguard our warriors from Daedric influence when claiming their relics on the field of battle.
