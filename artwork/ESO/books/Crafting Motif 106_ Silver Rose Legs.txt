Crafting Motif 106: Silver Rose Legs

By Chief Archivist Bartholomew

Like our namesake, the liveries of the venerable Knights of the Silver Rose have grown haler and more beautiful with each generation, tended by collective wisdom and guidance of our order. Here I record the essential elements of form and function in our arms and armaments as dictated by Prior Theirric Sarazen, Knight-Commander of the Silver Rose, 2E 579.

LEG GREAVES

Much like our boots, Silver Rose greaves are fashioned from extremely supple leathers that allow for the greatest ease of fit and range of motion. The addition of hardened leather reinforcements on the flanks provides adequate protection from the most common angles of attack, especially for our cavalry riders.
