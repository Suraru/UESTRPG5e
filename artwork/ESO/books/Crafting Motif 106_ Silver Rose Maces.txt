Crafting Motif 106: Silver Rose Maces

By Chief Archivist Bartholomew

Like our namesake, the liveries of the venerable Knights of the Silver Rose have grown haler and more beautiful with each generation, tended by collective wisdom and guidance of our order. Here I record the essential elements of form and function in our arms and armaments as dictated by Prior Theirric Sarazen, Knight-Commander of the Silver Rose, 2E 579.

MACES

Unlike our swords and axe heads, which are silver-plated steel, our warhammers are forged from a unique silver and platinum alloy created by the order's metallurgist, Viccaro Baumont in the late first era. While not as durable as steel, and quite costly, they have proven especially effective at shattering even a Clannfear's dense skull.
