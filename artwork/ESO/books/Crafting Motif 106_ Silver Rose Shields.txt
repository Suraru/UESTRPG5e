Crafting Motif 106: Silver Rose Shields

By Chief Archivist Bartholomew

Like our namesake, the liveries of the venerable Knights of the Silver Rose have grown haler and more beautiful with each generation, tended by collective wisdom and guidance of our order. Here I record the essential elements of form and function in our arms and armaments as dictated by Prior Theirric Sarazen, Knight-Commander of the Silver Rose, 2E 579.

SHIELDS

Every shield produced by our armorers is truly a work of art unto itself, each bearing elaborate engravings that would be the envy of any silversmith in High Rock. The annealed steel frame provides ample protection to both the wielder and the detailing, while the softer silver provides a certain amount of ductility that prevents shattering.
