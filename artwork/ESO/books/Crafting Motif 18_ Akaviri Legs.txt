Crafting Motif 18: Akaviri Legs

By Holgunn One-Eye

King Jorunn wants a description of the Akaviri styles of arms and armor written by someone who knows them. I don't think anyone killed more Akaviri than I did during the recent invasion from Kamal, so I guess that makes me an expert in their wares of war. Besides, who else was I going to get to write this? Rigurt?  

LEG GREAVES

Akaviri greaves always look like extensions of their sandal-like boots. I could never tell where one ends and the other starts.
