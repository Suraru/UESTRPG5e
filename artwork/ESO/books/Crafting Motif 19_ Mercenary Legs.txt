Crafting Motif 19: Mercenary Legs

By Gaspard Esmery, Captain of Gaspard's Stalkers

Mercenary companies got a bad reputation during Potentate Versidue-Shaie's War of Subjugation, when paid troops of Imperial vassals went rogue, pillaging their way across the provinces until the Legions brought them down.
