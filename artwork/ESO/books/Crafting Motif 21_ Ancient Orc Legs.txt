Crafting Motif 21: Ancient Orc Legs

By Curator Umutha of the House of Orsimer Glories

Here in Orsinium's museum of Orcish history, we are proud to display arms and armor created in the style of our ancient ancestors! Feel free to handle the items labeled "reproduction," but please admire the original relics in the display cases with your eyes only. 

LEG GREAVES

An Ancient Orc's greaves are a natural extension of the Old Orsimer's lovely bootsâ€”in fact, it's hard to tell where one ends and the other begins! They exemplify the perfect marriage of form with function! You can't get more Orcish than that.
