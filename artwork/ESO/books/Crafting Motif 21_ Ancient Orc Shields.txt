Crafting Motif 21: Ancient Orc Shields

By Curator Umutha of the House of Orsimer Glories

Here in Orsinium's museum of Orcish history, we are proud to display arms and armor created in the style of our ancient ancestors! Feel free to handle the items labeled "reproduction," but please admire the original relics in the display cases with your eyes only. 

SHIELDS

An Ancient Orc's shield is kite-shaped, of dense hardwood bolstered by overlapping and interlocking strips of metalâ€”but not too much, because a shield that's too heavy to move rapidly is no use in a melee!
