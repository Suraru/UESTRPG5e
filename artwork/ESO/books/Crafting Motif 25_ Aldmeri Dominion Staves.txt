Crafting Motif 25: Aldmeri Dominion Staves

Aldmeri Dominion Arms and Armor

By Aicantar of Shimmerene, Sapiarch of Indoctrination

Attention smiths, forgers, weapon-masters, and arms crafters: the following are the specifications for all work to be done for the Aldmeri Dominion military. We expect the finest workmanship in every piece, for those of Aldmeri heritage can do no less, but deviation from these norms is not acceptable. I have heard some commentary to the effect that the Aldmeri Eagle is overused in these designs. Such remarks are contrary to Praxis. 

Do it right. Do it well. Do it to honor the Ancestors.
 
STAVES

With their flaring winged heads, the weapons of Dominion spellcasters almost look more like pole-axes than magical stavesâ€”and indeed, many an arcane warrior has used them as such when in a tight spot.
