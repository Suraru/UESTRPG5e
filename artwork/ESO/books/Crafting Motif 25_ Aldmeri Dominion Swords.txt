Crafting Motif 25: Aldmeri Dominion Swords

Aldmeri Dominion Arms and Armor

By Aicantar of Shimmerene, Sapiarch of Indoctrination

Attention smiths, forgers, weapon-masters, and arms crafters: the following are the specifications for all work to be done for the Aldmeri Dominion military. We expect the finest workmanship in every piece, for those of Aldmeri heritage can do no less, but deviation from these norms is not acceptable. I have heard some commentary to the effect that the Aldmeri Eagle is overused in these designs. Such remarks are contrary to Praxis. 

Do it right. Do it well. Do it to honor the Ancestors.
 
SWORDS

Dominion swords are long, straight, and powerful, edged on either side, and with a blade that widens toward the tip before ending in a point. The eagle's-wing crossguards are sturdy enough to trap an opponent's blade on a parry and, with a twist, perform a disarming maneuver.
