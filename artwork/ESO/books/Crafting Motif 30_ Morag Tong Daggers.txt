Crafting Motif 30: Morag Tong Daggers

Guild Memo to the Recondite Forge

I've been asked to convey to you the Exalted Master's dissatisfaction with your recent work for the Tong. The Sun's Dusk shipment was unacceptable, not up to standard either in quality or style. We're going to give you one opportunity to redeem yourselves. Don't fail. In the interest of your … rehabilitation … I'll summarize our requirements for you below.

DAGGERS

The blade on a Morag Tong dagger should be an offset demi-crescent, with a hook or barb on the point so the dagger can double as a corpse meat-hook. The hook must be able to drag a body without bending or slipping out—which is what happened with that last batch you sent us. Don't you even test your work before you call it done?
