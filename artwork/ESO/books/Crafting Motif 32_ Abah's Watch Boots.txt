Crafting Motif 32: Abah's Watch Boots

At-Addin Syndicate Memo: Outfitting the Abah's Landing Watch

I just sold that Iron Wheel outfit a load of first-quality arms and armor—good enough that our own Abah's Landing guards are going to look shabby in comparison, and that's not going to do. We need to show a united front to the Wheel, with a standardized look to our guards. Based on what we've got in the warehouses, let's equip them as indicated below.

BOOTS

The basic goat-leather boots shipped in from Senchal ought to do fine: we have plenty of them, and nobody looks at a guard's feet anyway.  But make sure they have good quality straps at the ankle to attach to the bottom of the greaves.
