Crafting Motif 35: Dro-m'Athra Shields

By Twilight Cantor Adara'hai

Somewhere, deep in the Dark Behind the World, there are grim forges and bent benches where Lost Cats arm and armor themselves.

Because all knowledge is useful, no? If only to know what to stay away from. 

SHIELDS

Double-waning-crescent shield, Jode to right, Jone to left, with gaps in moon-sickles for stab-stabbing from behind it. See the blue lightning? Very dangerous: beware.
