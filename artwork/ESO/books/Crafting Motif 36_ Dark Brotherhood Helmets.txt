Crafting Motif 36: Dark Brotherhood Helmets

DARK BROTHERHOOD STYLE
By Speaker Terenus

Heed me, Initiates:  we are not soldiers, and do not wear a uniformâ€”it would be a difficult thing indeed to do our jobs if we had to wear gear that identified us as members of an order of assassins. But just because we don't typically use uniforms when on assignment doesn't mean we don't have them: we do. When it is necessary for you to represent the Dark Brotherhood in a manner that leaves no doubt as to our involvement in an affair, you will wear guild armor and wield guild arms as described below. 

HELMETS

The Initiate's headgear shall be a thick leather cowl accented by matte steel studs, with a lower half-mask to conceal the wearer's features. The cowl shall be of generous length so as to drape full to the shoulders.
