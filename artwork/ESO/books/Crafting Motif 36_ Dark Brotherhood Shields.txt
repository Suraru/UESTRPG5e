Crafting Motif 36: Dark Brotherhood Shields

DARK BROTHERHOOD STYLE
By Speaker Terenus

Heed me, Initiates:  we are not soldiers, and do not wear a uniformâ€”it would be a difficult thing indeed to do our jobs if we had to wear gear that identified us as members of an order of assassins. But just because we don't typically use uniforms when on assignment doesn't mean we don't have them: we do. When it is necessary for you to represent the Dark Brotherhood in a manner that leaves no doubt as to our involvement in an affair, you will wear guild armor and wield guild arms as described below. 

SHIELDS

The Initiate's shield shall be of oval kite-shape and large enough to protect a co-assassin as she plies her bow or spell staff. Upon the central boss shall be blazoned either the black or bloody hand.
