Crafting Motif 42: Hollowjack Belts

By the Hollowjack Cantor

Conjure, conjure, jill and jack
Harvest arms and armor tack
Pumpkin drear and black hawthorn
Wrought into grim garments worn

BELTS

Cincture hold our raiment tight
Sure and secure to prowl the night
Straps to hold our weapons near
Ready all for time of fear
