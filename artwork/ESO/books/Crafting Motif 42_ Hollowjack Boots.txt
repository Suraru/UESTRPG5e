Crafting Motif 42: Hollowjack Boots

By the Hollowjack Cantor

Conjure, conjure, jill and jack
Harvest arms and armor tack
Pumpkin drear and black hawthorn
Wrought into grim garments worn

BOOTS

Soles of rind and pointed toes
Shall surprise unwary foes
Hollowjack shall ever tread
On the corpses of the dead
