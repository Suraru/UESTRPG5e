Crafting Motif 42: Hollowjack Bows

By the Hollowjack Cantor

Conjure, conjure, jill and jack
Harvest arms and armor tack
Pumpkin drear and black hawthorn
Wrought into grim garments worn

BOWS

Thorn-tree wood, bend and release
Thor-ned arrow, mark decease
Flet-ched dart, twist and fly
Taking target through the eye
