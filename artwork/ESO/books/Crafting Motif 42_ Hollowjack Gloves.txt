Crafting Motif 42: Hollowjack Gloves

By the Hollowjack Cantor

Conjure, conjure, jill and jack
Harvest arms and armor tack
Pumpkin drear and black hawthorn
Wrought into grim garments worn

GLOVES

Thor-ned night-black gauntlets planned 
To cover Hollowjacky hand
But flexible so hands can strangle
Throttle, eye-gouge, tear, and mangle
