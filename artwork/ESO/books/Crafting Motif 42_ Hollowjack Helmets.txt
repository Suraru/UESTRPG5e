Crafting Motif 42: Hollowjack Helmets

By the Hollowjack Cantor

Conjure, conjure, jill and jack
Harvest arms and armor tack
Pumpkin drear and black hawthorn
Wrought into grim garments worn

HELMETS

Grinning Hollowjack must laugh
Dismember, threshing, wheat from chaff
Now inner anger embers show
As lambent eye-slits ever glow
