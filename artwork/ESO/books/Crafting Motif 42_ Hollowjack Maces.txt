Crafting Motif 42: Hollowjack Maces

By the Hollowjack Cantor

Conjure, conjure, jill and jack
Harvest arms and armor tack
Pumpkin drear and black hawthorn
Wrought into grim garments worn

MACES

Pointed hammer made to puncture
Mail and armor at their juncture
Hollowjack fair grins with glee
Murd'ring on a killing spree
