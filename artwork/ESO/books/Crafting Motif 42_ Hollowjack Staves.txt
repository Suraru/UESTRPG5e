Crafting Motif 42: Hollowjack Staves

By the Hollowjack Cantor

Conjure, conjure, jill and jack
Harvest arms and armor tack
Pumpkin drear and black hawthorn
Wrought into grim garments worn

STAVES

Summon segments, mirthful medley
Hollowjack staff long and deadly
Casting spells good and malign
Pumpkin daemon knows the sign
