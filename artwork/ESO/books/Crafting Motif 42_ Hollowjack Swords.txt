Crafting Motif 42: Hollowjack Swords

By the Hollowjack Cantor

Conjure, conjure, jill and jack
Harvest arms and armor tack
Pumpkin drear and black hawthorn
Wrought into grim garments worn

SWORDS

Sword to cut, a blade to sever
Crafting a condign endeavor
Point to pommel, edge to back
Scimitar for Hollowjack
