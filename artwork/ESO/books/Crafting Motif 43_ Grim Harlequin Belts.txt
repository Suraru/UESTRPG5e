Crafting Motif 43: Grim Harlequin Belts

GRIM HARLEQUIN STYLE
By Chamberlain Haskill

My Lord Sheogorath has directed me to compile a guide for those seeking to create "Grim Harlequin" arms and armor, so that the Mad God's mortal servants may have a way to make all their equipment look the same. Of course, this standardization runs counter to all other cult practices, and is insane on the face of it. (Ahem.) Milord has probably already forgotten he asked me to do it, but what better do I have to do with my time than write manuals for mortals? 

Actually, almost anything, now that I think about it. 

BELTS

The belt shall be made of one, two, three, or four leather straps, of tanned Human or Elf skin, where possible. A grinning skull for the buckle, of course. Hip tassets may also sport skulls, wearing fool's caps and with tongues extended. The extended tongue is very importantâ€”a stylistic hallmark, really.
