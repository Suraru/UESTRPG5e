Crafting Motif 47: Buoyant Armiger Belts

BUOYANT ARMIGER STYLE

By Lord Vivec

Vivec smiled at those brave souls around him and summoned celebration demons to cleave unto the victors. There was a great display of love and duty around the netted monster, and Vivec was at the center with a headdress made of mating bones. He laughed and told mystical jokes and made the heads of the three houses marry and become a new order. "You shall forever be now my Buoyant Armigers," he said.

BELTS

"A scavenger cannot acquire a silk sash and expect to discover the greater systems of its predecessor: perfect happiness is embraced only by the weeping." And the belt of the tassets and the arms of the Armiger shall be fore and aft a chevron, and descend in the places of generation.
