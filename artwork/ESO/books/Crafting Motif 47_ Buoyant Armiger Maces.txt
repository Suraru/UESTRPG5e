Crafting Motif 47: Buoyant Armiger Maces

BUOYANT ARMIGER STYLE

By Lord Vivec

Vivec smiled at those brave souls around him and summoned celebration demons to cleave unto the victors. There was a great display of love and duty around the netted monster, and Vivec was at the center with a headdress made of mating bones. He laughed and told mystical jokes and made the heads of the three houses marry and become a new order. "You shall forever be now my Buoyant Armigers," he said.

MACES

"Truth is like my husband: instructed to smash, filled with procedure and noise, hammering, weighty, heaviness made schematic, lessons learned only by a mace." And the terrible truncheon the Armiger bears shall be like the scepter of a king unforeseen and unreckoned.
