Crafting Motif 47: Buoyant Armiger Staves

BUOYANT ARMIGER STYLE

By Lord Vivec

Vivec smiled at those brave souls around him and summoned celebration demons to cleave unto the victors. There was a great display of love and duty around the netted monster, and Vivec was at the center with a headdress made of mating bones. He laughed and told mystical jokes and made the heads of the three houses marry and become a new order. "You shall forever be now my Buoyant Armigers," he said.

STAVES

"He attempted to attach them and form a staff but Vivec would not let him, saying, 'It is not the time for that.'" And thus the spell staff of the Armiger Magical shall be shaft-singular, and speak only contradictions.
