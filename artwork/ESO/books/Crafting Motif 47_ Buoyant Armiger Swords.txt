Crafting Motif 47: Buoyant Armiger Swords

BUOYANT ARMIGER STYLE

By Lord Vivec

Vivec smiled at those brave souls around him and summoned celebration demons to cleave unto the victors. There was a great display of love and duty around the netted monster, and Vivec was at the center with a headdress made of mating bones. He laughed and told mystical jokes and made the heads of the three houses marry and become a new order. "You shall forever be now my Buoyant Armigers," he said.

SWORDS

"The true sword is able to cut chains of generations, which is to say, the creation myths of your enemies." And therefore behold the Armiger's sword, by which I mean the sensible, by which I mean the first night, for which I mean the dual nature, preceded by a sigh.
