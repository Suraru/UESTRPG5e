Crafting Motif 52: Redoran Bows

By Vindamea Redoran, House Procurement Sister, Vivec City

Should any non-Redoran ask you why our arms and armor are inspired by the claws and chitin of gigantic arthropods, just ask them if they've seen any Emperor Crabs latelyâ€”you know, those cathedral-sized crustaceans that once roamed the ashlands of Vvardenfell. Where did those go? 

We killed them. We, the warriors of House Redoran. 

Duty, gravity, and piety: these are our watchwords. We are the wartime defenders of the House Dunmer of Morrowind. Follow the guidelines graven below for crafting in the Redoran style, and do not cut corners, for that would be unworthy of our House. 

BOWS

The classic Redoran bow is a composite of native funguswood and springy leg-chitin, faced with chitin plates on the limbs as they radiate from the grip. The quiver is of light chitin plates accented with bronze; arrows have broad, barbed heads.
