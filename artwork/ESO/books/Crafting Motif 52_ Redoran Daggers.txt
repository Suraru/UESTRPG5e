Crafting Motif 52: Redoran Daggers

By Vindamea Redoran, House Procurement Sister, Vivec City

Should any non-Redoran ask you why our arms and armor are inspired by the claws and chitin of gigantic arthropods, just ask them if they've seen any Emperor Crabs latelyâ€”you know, those cathedral-sized crustaceans that once roamed the ashlands of Vvardenfell. Where did those go? 

We killed them. We, the warriors of House Redoran. 

Duty, gravity, and piety: these are our watchwords. We are the wartime defenders of the House Dunmer of Morrowind. Follow the guidelines graven below for crafting in the Redoran style, and do not cut corners, for that would be unworthy of our House. 

DAGGERS

The Redoran dagger has a broad and relatively short blade that ends in two diverging prongs that can inflict savage wounds on an unarmored opponent. Our House blade-fighting style emphasizes cutting over thrusting, so the twin prongs are no liability against armor.
