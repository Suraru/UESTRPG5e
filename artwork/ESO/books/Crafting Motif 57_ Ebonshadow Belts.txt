Crafting Motif 57: Ebonshadow Belts

By Romien Garvette of the Whispering Shadows

You want to be beautiful. Beautiful, and whispering. Whispering, and dark. Dark, and beautiful, and whisperingâ€”with claws, such claws. You shall be cold, and sharp, and dark. You will be Ebonshadow.  

You cannot rest, you can never rest, so you might as well craft. Craft arms for Her will; craft armor for Her machinations. You are filled with dark nothingness, filled until you spill it into that which you shall make. And for that time of making, though you do it alone, that time alone will have Meaning. 

BELTS

It wraps around you, secure, never letting go. Holds you in its dark embrace, like Her embrace. You're bound within it, but it's yours! You created it! Within your hands you have created this darkness, this shadow, this black belt that binds you. Holds you.
