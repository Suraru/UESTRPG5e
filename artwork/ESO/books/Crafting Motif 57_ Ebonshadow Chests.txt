Crafting Motif 57: Ebonshadow Chests

By Romien Garvette of the Whispering Shadows

You want to be beautiful. Beautiful, and whispering. Whispering, and dark. Dark, and beautiful, and whisperingâ€”with claws, such claws. You shall be cold, and sharp, and dark. You will be Ebonshadow.  

You cannot rest, you can never rest, so you might as well craft. Craft arms for Her will; craft armor for Her machinations. You are filled with dark nothingness, filled until you spill it into that which you shall make. And for that time of making, though you do it alone, that time alone will have Meaning. 

CHESTS

You gasp, and gasp, but you cannot breathe. The weight of the darkness consumes you, pressing against the lungs, but now. Now you've crafted armor to protect you. Wrapped around your chest, against your dully-beating heart. It will stop the weight. It will protect you from that crushing weight.
