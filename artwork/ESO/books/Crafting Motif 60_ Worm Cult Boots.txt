Crafting Motif 60: Worm Cult Boots

By the Worm of Songs

In death is life, reanimation
A sacred and a dark vocation
Our Order's garb all shall recall
Their final sight before they fall 

BOOTS

Each sabaton is lapping, plated
Like those of Bal's dark legions
Our troops' corpses reanimated
Returned from deathly regions
