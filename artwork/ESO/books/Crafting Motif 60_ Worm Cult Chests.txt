Crafting Motif 60: Worm Cult Chests

By the Worm of Songs

In death is life, reanimation
A sacred and a dark vocation
Our Order's garb all shall recall
Their final sight before they fall 

CHESTS

Worm armor's plates are tributes all 
To our Lord of the Undead
The skin and form of Molag Bal
To steel and iron wed
