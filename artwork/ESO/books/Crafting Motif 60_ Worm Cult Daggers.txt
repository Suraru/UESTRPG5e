Crafting Motif 60: Worm Cult Daggers

By the Worm of Songs

In death is life, reanimation
A sacred and a dark vocation
Our Order's garb all shall recall
Their final sight before they fall 

DAGGERS

Like jagged fangs, our daggers curve
Serrated edge and point
Grim armaments, they also serve 
To sever and disjoint
