Crafting Motif 60: Worm Cult Helmets

By the Worm of Songs

In death is life, reanimation
A sacred and a dark vocation
Our Order's garb all shall recall
Their final sight before they fall 

HELMETS

Like metal skull of Daedric beast
Worm helm enwraps your head
Overlapping, layered, creased
March leading our undead
