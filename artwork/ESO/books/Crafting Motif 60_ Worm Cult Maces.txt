Crafting Motif 60: Worm Cult Maces

By the Worm of Songs

In death is life, reanimation
A sacred and a dark vocation
Our Order's garb all shall recall
Their final sight before they fall 

MACES

When slaying foes to animate
The mace has many charms
We want a corpse in wholesome state
With all its legs and arms
