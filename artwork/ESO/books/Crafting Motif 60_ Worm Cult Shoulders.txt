Crafting Motif 60: Worm Cult Shoulders

By the Worm of Songs

In death is life, reanimation
A sacred and a dark vocation
Our Order's garb all shall recall
Their final sight before they fall 

SHOULDERS

Pauldrons sharp as fang√©d skulls
Adorn Worm Cultists' shoulders
Mortals rise as Black Worm thralls
Or in their graves shall molder
