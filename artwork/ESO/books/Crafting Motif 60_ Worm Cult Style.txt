Crafting Motif 60: Worm Cult Style

By the Worm of Songs

In death is life, reanimation
A sacred and a dark vocation
Our Order's garb all shall recall
Their final sight before they fall 

AXES

Worm axe blade's like a severed ear
Restored to life as metal hacker
A mighty arm that all must fear
Glint of steel and gleam of lacquer

BELTS

Echoes of Coldharbour see
In cinctures, sashes, belts
On each hip are tassets three
With hooks for scalps or pelts

BOOTS

Each sabaton is lapping, plated
Like those of Bal's dark legions
Our troops' corpses reanimated
Returned from deathly regions

BOWS

From bones defleshed we craft our bows
They loose with bony rattle
The skeletal dart Worm archer throws
Slays men like so much cattle 

CHESTS

Worm armor's plates are tributes all 
To our Lord of the Undead
The skin and form of Molag Bal
To steel and iron wed

DAGGERS

Like jagged fangs, our daggers curve
Serrated edge and point
Grim armaments, they also serve 
To sever and disjoint  

GLOVES

Our gauntlets guard forearms and hands
Enabling fists to grip
With fingers clad in bony bands
Ensuring hafts don't slip

HELMETS

Like metal skull of Daedric beast
Worm helm enwraps your head
Overlapping, layered, creased
March leading our undead

LEG GREAVES

Chausses echo chest design
Coldharbour inspiration
Daedric chevron, curving line
Of Lord of Domination

MACES

When slaying foes to animate
The mace has many charms
We want a corpse in wholesome state
With all its legs and arms

SHIELDS

On Worm Cult shield the horns of Bal
Adorn o'erlapping plates
For undeath is the fate of all
Who pass Coldharbour's gates 

SHOULDERS

Pauldrons sharp as fangéd skulls
Adorn Worm Cultists' shoulders
Mortals rise as Black Worm thralls
Or in their graves shall molder 

STAVES

With spellstaff horned like Bal himself
Dark mages focus magic
Thus mortals—human, beast, or Elf
All meet their endings tragic    

SWORDS

Swords serrated, pointed, edged
To twist in mortals' entrails
March forth, Worm Cultist fully-fledged
Cause adversaries' wails
