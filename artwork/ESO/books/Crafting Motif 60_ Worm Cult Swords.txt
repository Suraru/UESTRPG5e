Crafting Motif 60: Worm Cult Swords

By the Worm of Songs

In death is life, reanimation
A sacred and a dark vocation
Our Order's garb all shall recall
Their final sight before they fall 

SWORDS

Swords serrated, pointed, edged
To twist in mortals' entrails
March forth, Worm Cultist fully-fledged
Cause adversaries' wails
