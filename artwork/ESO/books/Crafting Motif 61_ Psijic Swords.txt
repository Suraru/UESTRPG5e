Crafting Motif 61: Psijic Swords

By Loremaster Celarus

The Psijic Order eschews combat, regarding all violence as a failure of negotiation and diplomacy, which are the highest of the non-magical arts. Our garb, therefore, lacks the martial look and feel of most "armor"â€”but that doesn't mean it's any less protective than clanking suits of metal, for powerful protective runes are woven into the very substance of our robes. 

SWORDS

Each Psijic sword is elegant, beautifully embellished, and when forged, it's blessed with an orison praying it need never be drawn in anger. For at need, the straight, double-edged Psijic sword can cut a terrible swath, though its use may always be regretted.
