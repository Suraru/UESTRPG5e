Crafting Motif 62: Sapiarch Gloves

By Artuudawen Thousand-Shoes, Sapiarch of Apparel Analysis

Every detail has its own deep history, all memorialized, of course, in the Apparel Archives of the Crystal Tower. The lighter styles of robes are for research in controlled environments, while the heavier, armored robes provide protection when a Sapiarch must do research in the field.
