Crafting Motif 68: Honor Guard Style

By Kiasa-Veda, Chronicler of Blades, Dir-Tonenaka

To make gear rightly,
One must follow the old rules;
Error, dishonor

AXES

Axe is made to cut; 
The long edge slices open,
Then weight drives it through

BELTS

Warrior carries
Weight of weapons and honor;
A belt must know strength

BOOTS

Feet must feel the ground
Yet boot soles push it away;
Place your feet with care

BOWS

Archery reveals
Relation of heart and mind; 
Aim with the whole self  

CHESTS

Armor frees fighter
To think solely of attack;
It must be strong yet light

DAGGERS

Knife trades reach for speed;
Yet it must be forged as well
As a longer blade

GLOVES

Gauntlets defend hands,
Yet hands are the source of blows; 
Find the right balance

HELMETS

A well-guarded head
May wear a fearsome aspect;
Fight with the mind, too

LEG GREAVES

Intelligent foes
Will strike at a fighter's legs;
Good greaves forestall them

MACES

A blow from a mace
Can settle any debate; 
Wield strong arguments

SHIELDS

A shield is the face
That your foe sees from afar;
Wear a grim visage

SHOULDERS

Strong pauldron deflects
The unseen flanking attack;
Make it durable

STAVES

A spell is a tale,
A staff a storyteller;
"Once upon a timeâ€¦"

SWORDS

Akaviri swords
Often have slightly curved blades;
But Honor Guards' are straight
