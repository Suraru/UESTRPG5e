Crafting Motif 72: Meridian Shields

By Lady Cinnabar of Taneth

From ancient times till the present, the Cult of Meridia, no matter how often suppressed, always rebounds and reappears. Perhaps this is due to the fact that, for a Daedric Prince, the Lady of Infinite Energies rarely requires genuinely terrible behavior from her worshipers, though she can be severe on those she considers enemies. Mortals who revere her often honor her by adopting an armor style inspired by that of the Aurorans, Meridia's Daedric warriors. This look is so consistent among her cultists in every place and time that one can legitimately say there is a "Meridian" style.

SHIELDS

Wings, rays of energy, and the flow of light decorate the shields of those following Meridia. Multiple sharp edges on these shields also allow Meridian cultists to make particularly gory shield bashes.
