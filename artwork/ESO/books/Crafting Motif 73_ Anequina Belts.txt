Crafting Motif 73: Anequina Belts

By Captain Nala-do, Northern Elsweyr Defense Force

This one is determined to record the traditional appearance of Anequine arms and armor despite the attempts of Euraxia the Usurper Queen to replace them with new, inferior designs. Our martial traditions in the North date back to the time of Darloc Brae, and though nowadays we no longer employ his savage methods, one must confess that the Golden Beast had a truly Khajiiti sense of style in arms and armor.

BELTS

Anequine belts, as it is with most Khajiiti fashion, are both stylish and practical. After all, it would not do for warriors in the midst of battle to have their leggings fall down. Sleek and sturdy, these leather belts have proven themselves against the stress of combat time and time again.
