Crafting Motif 73: Anequina Boots

By Captain Nala-do, Northern Elsweyr Defense Force

This one is determined to record the traditional appearance of Anequine arms and armor despite the attempts of Euraxia the Usurper Queen to replace them with new, inferior designs. Our martial traditions in the North date back to the time of Darloc Brae, and though nowadays we no longer employ his savage methods, one must confess that the Golden Beast had a truly Khajiiti sense of style in arms and armor. 

BOOTS

In the desperation of combat, the Khajiit consider all possible attacks. Sometimes such desperation comes down to fighting fang and claw. With this in mind, the open toes of Anequine boots allow swift kicks to become piercing slashes. The style also allows relief in the hot climate of Elsweyr, giving our armies an edge against heavily armored invaders who quickly overheat.
