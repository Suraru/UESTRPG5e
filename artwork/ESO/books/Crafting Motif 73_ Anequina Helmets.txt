Crafting Motif 73: Anequina Helmets

By Captain Nala-do, Northern Elsweyr Defense Force

This one is determined to record the traditional appearance of Anequine arms and armor despite the attempts of Euraxia the Usurper Queen to replace them with new, inferior designs. Our martial traditions in the North date back to the time of Darloc Brae, and though nowadays we no longer employ his savage methods, one must confess that the Golden Beast had a truly Khajiiti sense of style in arms and armor. 

HELMETS

In days past, only the mightiest Khajiiti warriors would earn the right to wear the most fearsome of Anequine helmets. The faces of these helmets were said to be so grotesque that even fellow soldiers would shudder at the sight of them. It is a point of pride for Nala-do's people that we continue this tradition with fearsome masks of our own.
