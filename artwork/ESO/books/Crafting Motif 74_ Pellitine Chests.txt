Crafting Motif 74: Pellitine Chests

By Cashia Khrasaat-Plume, Envoy of the Mane, Torval

While it is an overstatement of the ignorant to characterize we Khajiit as flighty and superficial, it is true that not all of us, like this one, have the gift of precision in speech and writing. It is a worse mistake, but all too common among Tamrielic Men and Mer, to regard Khajiiti civilization as something shallow and recent. This is particularly false as regards the seven kingdoms that became the Federation of Pellitine, a land with a history long and deep. This Servant of the Mane hopes, in the few lines that follow, to cast some light on our Southern Elsweyr military traditions. 

CHESTS

Torval's damp climate and our distaste for restrictive clothing make metal armor very unpopular here in Southern Elsweyr. Leave heavy iron hauberks to the hoary Nords and flat-footed Bretons, yes? A Pellitine cuirass, by contrast, is typically made of durable boiled leather, shaped, stamped, and tailored to fit the wearer's torso like a glove.
