Crafting Motif 74: Pellitine Daggers

By Cashia Khrasaat-Plume, Envoy of the Mane, Torval

While it is an overstatement of the ignorant to characterize we Khajiit as flighty and superficial, it is true that not all of us, like this one, have the gift of precision in speech and writing. It is a worse mistake, but all too common among Tamrielic Men and Mer, to regard Khajiiti civilization as something shallow and recent. This is particularly false as regards the seven kingdoms that became the Federation of Pellitine, a land with a history long and deep. This Servant of the Mane hopes, in the few lines that follow, to cast some light on our Southern Elsweyr military traditions.

No shape is more distinctive to the Khajiiti people than the curve. The rounded crescents of Jone and Jode and the natural flexure of our fangs and claws are both given voice in the Pellitine dagger. The whorled guard and roaring pommel likewise reflect the frightful mysteries of Khajiiti culture!
