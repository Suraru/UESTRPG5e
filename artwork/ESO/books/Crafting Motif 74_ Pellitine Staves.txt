Crafting Motif 74: Pellitine Staves

By Cashia Khrasaat-Plume, Envoy of the Mane, Torval

While it is an overstatement of the ignorant to characterize we Khajiit as flighty and superficial, it is true that not all of us, like this one, have the gift of precision in speech and writing. It is a worse mistake, but all too common among Tamrielic Men and Mer, to regard Khajiiti civilization as something shallow and recent. This is particularly false as regards the seven kingdoms that became the Federation of Pellitine, a land with a history long and deep. This Servant of the Mane hopes, in the few lines that follow, to cast some light on our Southern Elsweyr military traditions.

When it comes to martial refinement, the Pellitine staff is a weapon without peer. While the haft is almost always fashioned out of stout Tenmar oak, the headpiece is a bronzesmith's masterpiece. Fragile lotus blossoms and grand chandeliers rest atop the staff like a king's crown, making even the most boorish wielder look like royalty.
