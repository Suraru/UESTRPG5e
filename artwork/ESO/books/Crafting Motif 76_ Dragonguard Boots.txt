Crafting Motif 76: Dragonguard Boots

By Sidura, Navigator of the Perfect Pounce

This one notes that she received permission to look for equipment before she dragged out all the Dragonguard gear on Tideholm. In no way did she gain these items through ill-advised means. Then Sidura spent some time updating and repairing them, with the help of some skilled volunteers. They turned out nicely, yes? Old Dragonguard mixed with new! Dashing and functional!

BOOTS

Old Dragonguard used a range of light and heavy materials to protect their feet. Sidura made sure to keep those sensibilities intact while enhancing the decorative elements. Don't worry about ankle slices with this footwearâ€”we added extra protection there due to cultists.
