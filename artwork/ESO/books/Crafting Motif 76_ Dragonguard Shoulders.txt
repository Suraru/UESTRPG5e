Crafting Motif 76: Dragonguard Shoulders

By Sidura, Navigator of the Perfect Pounce

This one notes that she received permission to look for equipment before she dragged out all the Dragonguard gear on Tideholm. In no way did she gain these items through ill-advised means. Then Sidura spent some time updating and repairing them, with the help of some skilled volunteers. They turned out nicely, yes? Old Dragonguard mixed with new! Dashing and functional!

SHOULDERS

Sidura once took a shoulder slice, so she knows well the value of protecting your shoulders. These pieces match the rest of the armor, though this one added some more embellishment. The arm cops and pauldrons even feature a fabric accent. Sweet, yes?
