Crafting Motif 76: Dragonguard Swords

By Sidura, Navigator of the Perfect Pounce

This one notes that she received permission to look for equipment before she dragged out all the Dragonguard gear on Tideholm. In no way did she gain these items through ill-advised means. Then Sidura spent some time updating and repairing them, with the help of some skilled volunteers. They turned out nicely, yes? Old Dragonguard mixed with new! Dashing and functional!

SWORDS

Looking at the sword made Sidura wonder: Why the serrations near the guard? What does this say about the Dragonguard fighting style? Is there a part of a Dragon you can entrap? Then Sidura realized: Dragonguard warriors must have had to fight people with weapons, too! So versatile!
