Crafting Motif 78: Moongrave Shields

As decreed by Clan Mother Nisaazda

Children, you came to me seeking something greater than the life you were given. This one promised you power beyond your imagining. Through her blood, she has given you only a taste. Soon Nisaazda will show you the heights we can reach. All we must do is follow her chosen Devourer and claim the greatest prey this world has to offer: Dragons. To prepare for this hunt we will learn from the Dragonguard and outfit ourselves accordingly. The trappings of a Hollowfang Dragon hunter are outline herein.

SHIELDS

Our shields shall bear the hallmarks of the Akaviri and Khajiit traditions in perfect unison. They shall be our emblem, representing the evolution of our clan.
