Crafting Motif 79: Refabricated Belts

By Dreyla Indavel, Halls of Fabrication

There's a Vehk of a lot of salvage material available if you want to bash together some wicked arms and armor, but there are certain ways the bits fit together for best results. We mainly use parts from those old decommissioned "D-series" Factotums, but there's also a place for more modern Factotum parts, and even some old Dwarven pieces. Here are my recommendations (and I ought to know): 

BELTS

For a really tough belt, get the elasti-strap from a belt-driven sump piston and mount it with a series of rigi-plates from the old die-stamp feeder bins. That'll get you a belt with enough tensile strength to support anything you care to hang on it, up to and including a lead-sledge.
