Crafting Motif 79: Refabricated Gloves

For the flexible parts of Refabricated gloves, we repurpose the relatively soft duraweave fabric used in Ventral Terminus refuse-sacs, then stud it with syncro-disks dug out of the metallics dump behind the Halls of Fabrication. For heavier armor, more disks.
