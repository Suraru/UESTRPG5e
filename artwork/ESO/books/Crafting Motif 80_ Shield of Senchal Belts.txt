Crafting Motif 80: Shield of Senchal Belts

By Centurion Ancrus Vesnentia of the Shields of Senchal, Thirteenth Legion

Southern Elsweyr resisted our arrival when Emperor Aquilarious gave the order. Considering the brutality that plagued the countryside for nearly two decades beforehand, it only makes sense. The Thirteenth Legion prepared for such circumstances, however, and I believe that preparedness won us the trust of the Khajiit over time. We came to restore order to Southern Elsweyr, but we stayed to protect its people. Over time, the Khajiit began to call us the Shields of Senchal. 

BELTS

While I may be alone in this thought, I firmly believe a good belt provides the foundation for a good soldier. Hung low on the hips and studded with an engraved metal buckle, we strive for an accessory that is as functional as it is striking.
