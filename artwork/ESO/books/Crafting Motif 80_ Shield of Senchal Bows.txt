Crafting Motif 80: Shield of Senchal Bows

By Centurion Ancrus Vesnentia of the Shields of Senchal, Thirteenth Legion

Southern Elsweyr resisted our arrival when Emperor Aquilarious gave the order. Considering the brutality that plagued the countryside for nearly two decades beforehand, it only makes sense. The Thirteenth Legion prepared for such circumstances, however, and I believe that preparedness won us the trust of the Khajiit over time. We came to restore order to Southern Elsweyr, but we stayed to protect its people. Over time, the Khajiit began to call us the Shields of Senchal. 

BOWS

The Khajiit have some â€¦ interesting ideas about archery. Still, there is always something to be learned. Like their bows, we adapted our own to be of finer metal, and began to see the promising (if not unsavory) uses of senche-gut bow-strings. The styling remains unique to our order however, with intricate carvings along the grip and distinctive colorings.
