Crafting Motif 80: Shield of Senchal Daggers

By Centurion Ancrus Vesnentia of the Shields of Senchal, Thirteenth Legion

Southern Elsweyr resisted our arrival when Emperor Aquilarious gave the order. Considering the brutality that plagued the countryside for nearly two decades beforehand, it only makes sense. The Thirteenth Legion prepared for such circumstances, however, and I believe that preparedness won us the trust of the Khajiit over time. We came to restore order to Southern Elsweyr, but we stayed to protect its people. Over time, the Khajiit began to call us the Shields of Senchal. 

DAGGERS

General Renmus insists "A good dagger need not be distinctive, for those who meet its edge will never see it coming, and not live to remember it." I'm not the wordsmith that he is, but it remains a truth that our daggers are more functional than decorative. The carvings around the hilt and on the blade itself pay homage to Khajiiti design, but we have stuck fast to our straight, thick blades.
