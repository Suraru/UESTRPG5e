Crafting Motif 80: Shield of Senchal Shields

By Centurion Ancrus Vesnentia of the Shields of Senchal, Thirteenth Legion

Southern Elsweyr resisted our arrival when Emperor Aquilarious gave the order. Considering the brutality that plagued the countryside for nearly two decades beforehand, it only makes sense. The Thirteenth Legion prepared for such circumstances, however, and I believe that preparedness won us the trust of the Khajiit over time. We came to restore order to Southern Elsweyr, but we stayed to protect its people. Over time, the Khajiit began to call us the Shields of Senchal. 


SHIELDS

Decorated with ornate crescents, golden chains and intricate compound, our signature instrument could never be accused of subtly. Nor should it. The shield functions as so much more than just a shield. It is the very symbol of our order. It inspires courage and serves as a manifestation of our purpose.
