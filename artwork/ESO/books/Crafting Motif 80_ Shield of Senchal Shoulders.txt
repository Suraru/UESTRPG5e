Crafting Motif 80: Shield of Senchal Shoulders

By Centurion Ancrus Vesnentia of the Shields of Senchal, Thirteenth Legion

Southern Elsweyr resisted our arrival when Emperor Aquilarious gave the order. Considering the brutality that plagued the countryside for nearly two decades beforehand, it only makes sense. The Thirteenth Legion prepared for such circumstances, however, and I believe that preparedness won us the trust of the Khajiit over time. We came to restore order to Southern Elsweyr, but we stayed to protect its people. Over time, the Khajiit began to call us the Shields of Senchal. 

SHOULDERS

The number of dangers one can encounter in Southern Elsweyr remains beyond counting. While shoulder plating will not stave off the worst of it, it serves well as a good first layer of defense. The bright metal pauldrons wink like pointed fangs in the hot sun.
