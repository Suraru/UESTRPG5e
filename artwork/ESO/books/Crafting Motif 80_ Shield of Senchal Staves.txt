Crafting Motif 80: Shield of Senchal Staves

By Centurion Ancrus Vesnentia of the Shields of Senchal, Thirteenth Legion

Southern Elsweyr resisted our arrival when Emperor Aquilarious gave the order. Considering the brutality that plagued the countryside for nearly two decades beforehand, it only makes sense. The Thirteenth Legion prepared for such circumstances, however, and I believe that preparedness won us the trust of the Khajiit over time. We came to restore order to Southern Elsweyr, but we stayed to protect its people. Over time, the Khajiit began to call us the Shields of Senchal. 


STAVES

It would be a mistake to assume the elegance of the Shield's staff undermines its strength. Far from it! Though topped with elaborate bronze sculptures and wrapped with sinuous, dyed leather studded with gold beads, the staff boasts lethality in abundance. An all-seeing eye tops the staff, and no enemy escapes its gaze.
