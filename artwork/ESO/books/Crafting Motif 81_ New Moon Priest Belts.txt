Crafting Motif 81: New Moon Priest Belts

By Fadai, Arcane Quartermaster, Order of the New Moon

Some believe that the Order of the New Moon grows too quickly. The fear and confusion felt upon witnessing the rage of Dragons has led many into our ranks. This one says the newcomers should be embraced! Lord Laatvulon offers his protection to all wise enough to accept it. Of course, production of the required priestly garments will need to increase. Fadai gladly offers guidance on crafting vestments and how best to incorporate the aeonstones into their designs.

BELTS

Due to the flowing nature of even our heavier vestments, the modest belt performs a crucial service. Without them, garments could easily snag and tear, leaving a priest vulnerable. The silver buckles guarantee a close fit while still honoring sacraments.
