Crafting Motif 81: New Moon Priest Bows

By Fadai, Arcane Quartermaster, Order of the New Moon

Some believe that the Order of the New Moon grows too quickly. The fear and confusion felt upon witnessing the rage of Dragons has led many into our ranks. This one says the newcomers should be embraced! Lord Laatvulon offers his protection to all wise enough to accept it. Of course, production of the required priestly garments will need to increase. Fadai gladly offers guidance on crafting vestments and how best to incorporate the aeonstones into their designs.

BOWS

Although powerful, the Dragons exhibit a grace in their movements. The gentle fold of the wings. The curve of the neck before releasing a plume of flame. So, too, is our bow just as gentle and deadly. The aeonstone spikes are arranged to resemble the scale patterns of our lord.
