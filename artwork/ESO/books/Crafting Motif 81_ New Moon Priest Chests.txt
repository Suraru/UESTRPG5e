Crafting Motif 81: New Moon Priest Chests

By Fadai, Arcane Quartermaster, Order of the New Moon

Some believe that the Order of the New Moon grows too quickly. The fear and confusion felt upon witnessing the rage of Dragons has led many into our ranks. This one says the newcomers should be embraced! Lord Laatvulon offers his protection to all wise enough to accept it. Of course, production of the required priestly garments will need to increase. Fadai gladly offers guidance on crafting vestments and how best to incorporate the aeonstones into their designs.

CHESTS

As members of a religious order, we expect our priests to don robes when carrying out their sacred roles. Since this often includes vicious combat, the garments are reinforced with thick leathers and silver plating while flowing open at the bottom. The perfect blend of devotion and defense.
