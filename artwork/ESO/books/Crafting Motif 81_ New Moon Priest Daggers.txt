Crafting Motif 81: New Moon Priest Daggers

By Fadai, Arcane Quartermaster, Order of the New Moon

Some believe that the Order of the New Moon grows too quickly. The fear and confusion felt upon witnessing the rage of Dragons has led many into our ranks. This one says the newcomers should be embraced! Lord Laatvulon offers his protection to all wise enough to accept it. Of course, production of the required priestly garments will need to increase. Fadai gladly offers guidance on crafting vestments and how best to incorporate the aeonstones into their designs.

DAGGERS

We honor the superiority of Dragons by placing their image onto these simple daggers. Straight, sleek blades contrast against the sharp spikes of the guard and pommel. The hilt's texture resembles scales which provides optimal grip.
