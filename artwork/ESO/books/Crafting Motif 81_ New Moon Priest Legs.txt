Crafting Motif 81: New Moon Priest Legs

By Fadai, Arcane Quartermaster, Order of the New Moon

Some believe that the Order of the New Moon grows too quickly. The fear and confusion felt upon witnessing the rage of Dragons has led many into our ranks. This one says the newcomers should be embraced! Lord Laatvulon offers his protection to all wise enough to accept it. Of course, production of the required priestly garments will need to increase. Fadai gladly offers guidance on crafting vestments and how best to incorporate the aeonstones into their designs.

LEG GREAVES

The duties of priests of the New Moon call for violence more often than typical religious followers. Our greaves are flexible enough so that they don't hinder the wearer, but provide the hardy protection needed to defend lord Laatvulon's mission.
