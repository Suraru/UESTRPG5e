Crafting Motif 81: New Moon Priest Staves

By Fadai, Arcane Quartermaster, Order of the New Moon

Some believe that the Order of the New Moon grows too quickly. The fear and confusion felt upon witnessing the rage of Dragons has led many into our ranks. This one says the newcomers should be embraced! Lord Laatvulon offers his protection to all wise enough to accept it. Of course, production of the required priestly garments will need to increase. Fadai gladly offers guidance on crafting vestments and how best to incorporate the aeonstones into their designs.

STAVES

If any might be confused as to who the Order considers supreme, we have placed a Dragon's terrible image onto the head of our staves. We craft these from dark ironwood for a satisfying heft. Aeonstones are embedded in the crest so that casters may amplify their spellcraft with them.
