Crafting Motif 81: New Moon Priest Swords

By Fadai, Arcane Quartermaster, Order of the New Moon

Some believe that the Order of the New Moon grows too quickly. The fear and confusion felt upon witnessing the rage of Dragons has led many into our ranks. This one says the newcomers should be embraced! Lord Laatvulon offers his protection to all wise enough to accept it. Of course, production of the required priestly garments will need to increase. Fadai gladly offers guidance on crafting vestments and how best to incorporate the aeonstones into their designs.

SWORDS

Some who claim to worship Dragons will craft their blades to curve into claws. The Order knows that we are destined to ascent higher. Our swords are forged straight, with the image of our lord on the guard. When held aloft, they point directly to where the New Moon will form in the night sky.
