Crafting Motif 82: Icereach Coven Maces

By Svarrid Snow-Seer, Guard of Windhelm 

When the Icereach Coven returned to Skyrim, they did so in force. They bolstered their numbers with Reachmen, lured innocents to their cause and plunged this land into chaos. Little is known about the witches that make up this sinister faction, and even less is known about the kind of weapons and armor they adorn themselves with. It is my duty to report on these aspects of the Icereach Coven as best I can so that we may learn more about our enemy. 

MACES
The witches wield horrifying maces. The damage is twofold, with one side splayed out with bones and bark that have been sharpened into hard points for piercing through thick armor. The other side of the head looks like maces we're used to, though made from a stone-hard wood. Not many who encounter these weapons survive the experience.
