Crafting Motif 84: Blackreach Vanguard Boots

By Captain Thromkir of the Blackreach Vanguard of Dusktown

The few brave enough to venture to Blackreach found themselves in need of specialized protection early on. While this place remains unpredictable, it has a wealth of resources that are easily harvested and can be turned against it. Much of the process is still trial and error, but it's been refined to a point where I believe it's pertinent to take record of. I imagine the longer people exist in Blackreach, the more nuanced these practices will become. 

BOOTS
There's a lot you don't want to step on in Blackreach. You'd think that most of the things down here that want to take a bite out of you are easy to spot. Not the case! It gets so dark that the nasty things that skitter along the ground go by unnoticed. If you don't have proper footwear, you're bound to step on something that'll kill you.
