Crafting Motif 84: Blackreach Vanguard Bows

By Captain Thromkir of the Blackreach Vanguard of Dusktown

The few brave enough to venture to Blackreach found themselves in need of specialized protection early on. While this place remains unpredictable, it has a wealth of resources that are easily harvested and can be turned against it. Much of the process is still trial and error, but it's been refined to a point where I believe it's pertinent to take record of. I imagine the longer people exist in Blackreach, the more nuanced these practices will become. 

BOWS
Blackreach provides unique opportunities for improving bows' heft and accuracy. Sharp chitin plates adorn the upper and lower limbs as well as the arrow tips. This sharp, near indestructible material provides stability to the weapon while lessening the overall weight of it.
