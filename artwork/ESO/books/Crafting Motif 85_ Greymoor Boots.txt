Crafting Motif 85: Greymoor Boots

By Captain Viddgryr, Guard of Solitude 

The Gray Host needs little introduction. The ancient army, risen anew, plagues our lands with little regard for the lives they take. I believe it is important for us to know our enemy. Many have clashed blades with these terrors, but are woefully misinformed about their weapons and armor. Here, I intend to make a detailed account of everything we know about the Gray Host's armaments in hopes that those who read will be better prepared.

BOOTS
There is a refinement and delicate quality to the design of the Host's apparel that tends to be misleading. Their boots are no different. Thin gold plates of metal lead down to a reinforced sole. Pointed like daggers, I imagine the toes are capable of inflicting nearly as much damage as daggers themselves.
