Crafting Motif 85: Greymoor Daggers

By Captain Viddgryr, Guard of Solitude 

The Gray Host needs little introduction. The ancient army, risen anew, plagues our lands with little regard for the lives they take. I believe it is important for us to know our enemy. Many have clashed blades with these terrors, but are woefully misinformed about their weapons and armor. Here, I intend to make a detailed account of everything we know about the Gray Host's armaments in hopes that those who read will be better prepared.

DAGGER
An ignorant observer might think the Host's daggers look flimsy. But as many can attest to, the thin nature of the blade, though it looks more apt to sting than stab, is just as deadly a dagger as any other. The precision the design lends makes it an especially dangerous weapon.
