Crafting Motif 85: Greymoor Helmets

By Captain Viddgryr, Guard of Solitude 

The Gray Host needs little introduction. The ancient army, risen anew, plagues our lands with little regard for the lives they take. I believe it is important for us to know our enemy. Many have clashed blades with these terrors, but are woefully misinformed about their weapons and armor. Here, I intend to make a detailed account of everything we know about the Gray Host's armaments in hopes that those who read will be better prepared.

HELMET
Dark onyx-colored plating makes up the helms of the Gray Host. Sharp horns, like those of a Dragon, stud the crown. Gold accents flare out like wings across the visor. Some faces are left open, others concealed so only a flash of animalistic eyes can be seen within. The word most commonly brought to mind when viewing these helms is â€¦ sharp.
