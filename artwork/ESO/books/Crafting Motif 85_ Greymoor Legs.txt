Crafting Motif 85: Greymoor Legs

By Captain Viddgryr, Guard of Solitude 

The Gray Host needs little introduction. The ancient army, risen anew, plagues our lands with little regard for the lives they take. I believe it is important for us to know our enemy. Many have clashed blades with these terrors, but are woefully misinformed about their weapons and armor. Here, I intend to make a detailed account of everything we know about the Gray Host's armaments in hopes that those who read will be better prepared.

LEG GREAVES
The Gray Host fashion their greaves out of dark leather. The material joins like plating, though that's hard to see in the night. These are measures for stealth, most certainly. Though they do add protection in the form of the same gold metal material along the hips and across the knees in most cases.
