Crafting Motif 85: Greymoor Maces

By Captain Viddgryr, Guard of Solitude 

The Gray Host needs little introduction. The ancient army, risen anew, plagues our lands with little regard for the lives they take. I believe it is important for us to know our enemy. Many have clashed blades with these terrors, but are woefully misinformed about their weapons and armor. Here, I intend to make a detailed account of everything we know about the Gray Host's armaments in hopes that those who read will be better prepared.

MACES
Personally, I think the Host maces look closer to tridents than anything else. Multiple prongs make up the bludgeoning force of the weapon. They stack them neatly around the top, and the hooked edges are perfect to snag and tear at flesh.
