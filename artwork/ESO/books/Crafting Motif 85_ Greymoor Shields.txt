Crafting Motif 85: Greymoor Shields

By Captain Viddgryr, Guard of Solitude 

The Gray Host needs little introduction. The ancient army, risen anew, plagues our lands with little regard for the lives they take. I believe it is important for us to know our enemy. Many have clashed blades with these terrors, but are woefully misinformed about their weapons and armor. Here, I intend to make a detailed account of everything we know about the Gray Host's armaments in hopes that those who read will be better prepared.

SHIELD
Heavy, twisted whorls of metal adorn the shields of the Host. The intricate carvings inspire fear. Perhaps it is because of the unmistakable symbol of their forces. Others say they see horrible faces in the curves of metal, as if the shields grin horribly while wielded by their masters.
