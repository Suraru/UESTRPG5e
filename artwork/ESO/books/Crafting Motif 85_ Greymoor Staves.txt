Crafting Motif 85: Greymoor Staves

By Captain Viddgryr, Guard of Solitude 

The Gray Host needs little introduction. The ancient army, risen anew, plagues our lands with little regard for the lives they take. I believe it is important for us to know our enemy. Many have clashed blades with these terrors, but are woefully misinformed about their weapons and armor. Here, I intend to make a detailed account of everything we know about the Gray Host's armaments in hopes that those who read will be better prepared.

STAVES
The Host's staves look incredibly similar to their maces, just diminished in size. The head of the staff almost resembles terrible talons. Perhaps it is meant to resemble the vampire lords themselves. Either way, they are a horrible sight.
