Crafting Motif 86: Sea Giant Axes

By Varcent Eardrey

We know very little about Sea Giants. What scraps of information about the elusive species we've gleaned thus far certainly fail to paint a clear picture. We're reasonably certain that Sea Giants are fearsome hunters, as harvesting great whales could be no easy task. That they stay such a mystery and point of terror for many seafaring Nords should be more than enough of an incentive to try to integrate their techniques into our own.

AXES
From studying the carcass of a Sea Giant hunt, we know that the Sea Giants can fashion a weapon similar to a harpoon in construction. Putting this addition into the structure of an axe makes an already deadly weapon capable of grievous damage.
