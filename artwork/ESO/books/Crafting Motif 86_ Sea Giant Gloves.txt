Crafting Motif 86: Sea Giant Gloves

By Varcent Eardrey

We know very little about Sea Giants. What scraps of information about the elusive species we've gleaned thus far certainly fail to paint a clear picture. We're reasonably certain that Sea Giants are fearsome hunters, as harvesting great whales could be no easy task. That they stay such a mystery and point of terror for many seafaring Nords should be more than enough of an incentive to try to integrate their techniques into our own.

GLOVES
Fish scales and fish teeth are underutilized in armor crafting, if I may be so bold as to say so. They have the distinct advantage of being lightweight but incredibly durable. If the Sea Giants are intelligent enough to repurpose inedible parts of their prey, they might see the benefit of protecting the hand with such materials. We surely will.
