Crafting Motif 86: Sea Giant Helmets

By Varcent Eardrey

We know very little about Sea Giants. What scraps of information about the elusive species we've gleaned thus far certainly fail to paint a clear picture. We're reasonably certain that Sea Giants are fearsome hunters, as harvesting great whales could be no easy task. That they stay such a mystery and point of terror for many seafaring Nords should be more than enough of an incentive to try to integrate their techniques into our own.

HELMETS
Though stories of Sea Giant sightings are often greatly exaggerated, there is one unifying theme: they are a fearsome sight to behold. The fact that these towering barbarians have mastered sea travel is intimidating enough. If we are to take after them, we must use our helmets to inspire similar fear. Thick horker tusks, shimmering fish scales, and long plates of bone mimic the Sea Giants' chilling appearance.
