Crafting Motif 86: Sea Giant Legs

By Varcent Eardrey

We know very little about Sea Giants. What scraps of information about the elusive species we've gleaned thus far certainly fail to paint a clear picture. We're reasonably certain that Sea Giants are fearsome hunters, as harvesting great whales could be no easy task. That they stay such a mystery and point of terror for many seafaring Nords should be more than enough of an incentive to try to integrate their techniques into our own.

LEG GREAVES
If Sea Giants are anything like their land-dwelling cousins, they probably do not feel the need for leg greaves. Still, Sea Giants must brave frigid waters to hunt down their prey. Boiled horker leather both retains warmth and protects just as well as any other material. Reinforcing our own greaves with bones and the scales of mighty fish might get us close to the Sea Giant's greatness.
