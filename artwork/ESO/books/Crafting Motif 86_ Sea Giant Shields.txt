Crafting Motif 86: Sea Giant Shields

By Varcent Eardrey

We know very little about Sea Giants. What scraps of information about the elusive species we've gleaned thus far certainly fail to paint a clear picture. We're reasonably certain that Sea Giants are fearsome hunters, as harvesting great whales could be no easy task. That they stay such a mystery and point of terror for many seafaring Nords should be more than enough of an incentive to try to integrate their techniques into our own.

SHIELDS
A race as savage as Sea Giants probably eschew protective items like shields. That does not mean we can't iterate on our own shields as they might. Bone must be a plentiful resource for themâ€”much more plentiful than wood or steel considering their seafaring nature. Attaching pieces to the edges of the shields we have already gives them added protection, lethality, and style!
