Crafting Motif 86: Sea Giant Style

By Varcent Eardrey

We know very little about Sea Giants. What scraps of information about the elusive species we've gleaned thus far certainly fail to paint a clear picture. We're reasonably certain that Sea Giants are fearsome hunters, as harvesting great whales could be no easy task. That they stay such a mystery and point of terror for many seafaring Nords should be more than enough of an incentive to try to integrate their techniques into our own.

AXES
From studying the carcass of a Sea Giant hunt, we know that the Sea Giants can fashion a weapon similar to a harpoon in construction. Putting this addition into the structure of an axe makes an already deadly weapon capable of grievous damage. 

BELTS
Those who claim to have seen Sea Giants in the flesh describe clothing festooned with skulls and long, serrated teeth. The skull of a sabre cat would look as small as a bird's skull on such a large creature. Despite our smaller frame, we can still use such adornments. Bird skulls and slaughterfish teeth would make equally terrifying additions to our belts.

BOOTS
From what we can tell, Sea Giants use a great deal of bone in their weaponry. Logic dictates that they also use such methods in their clothing, minimal as it is. Whale bone makes for especially good structural support in footwear, as well as a strong offensive component when placed on the outside of the shin. 

BOWS
Carved bone adds weight to bows, as well as stability. It's not clear whether Sea Giants themselves use bows or any kind of ranged weaponry, but if they did, I imagine it would be something like a quiver made from horker leather and arrows tipped with feathers from the wings of seafaring birds.

CHESTS
Sailors often trade tales of the Sea Giants' fish scale armor. While the origin of these massive scales remains a frightful mystery, they no doubt make for stout protection. Sewing these plates into the chests of boiled leather armor pieces provides an incredibly solid line of protection.

DAGGERS
Sea Giants themselves likely use crude daggers, or what we would call short swords. From the evidence we've seen in whale carcasses, long slashes and cuts signal the use of blades. If we take anything from their inspiration, it should be the sheer slashing power of the blade and supple horker leather at the hilt.

GLOVES
Fish scales and fish teeth are underutilized in armor crafting, if I may be so bold as to say so. They have the distinct advantage of being lightweight but incredibly durable. If the Sea Giants are intelligent enough to repurpose inedible parts of their prey, they might see the benefit of protecting the hand with such materials. We surely will.

HELMETS
Though stories of Sea Giant sightings are often greatly exaggerated, there is one unifying theme: they are a fearsome sight to behold. The fact that these towering barbarians have mastered sea travel is intimidating enough. If we are to take after them, we must use our helmets to inspire similar fear. Thick horker tusks, shimmering fish scales, and long plates of bone mimic the Sea Giants' chilling appearance.

LEG GREAVES
If Sea Giants are anything like their land-dwelling cousins, they probably do not feel the need for leg greaves. Still, Sea Giants must brave frigid waters to hunt down their prey. Boiled horker leather both retains warmth and protects just as well as any other material. Reinforcing our own greaves with bones and the scales of mighty fish might get us close to the Sea Giant's greatness.

MACES
Those who claim to witness Sea Giants out upon the water describe terrifying figureheads at the bows of their vessels. Descriptions range from horrible gargoyles to ugly depictions of what might be horkers. No one knows for certain if these exist, but the concept makes for interesting mace design. Four figureheads with fierce faces, turned out, ready to clobber their enemies!

SHIELDS
A race as savage as Sea Giants probably eschew protective items like shields. That does not mean we can't iterate on our own shields as they might. Bone must be a plentiful resource for themâ€”much more plentiful than wood or steel considering their seafaring nature. Attaching pieces to the edges of the shields we have already gives them added protection, lethality, and style! 

SHOULDERS
We have no verified accounts of Sea Giant ships, but one would have to surmise that they are massive. To hold a hunting party of such size would take a colossal vessel. Armor can inspire the same kind of wonder. Imagine shoulder pauldrons with ship figureheads carved in miniature out of bone, to make the wearer a vessel themselves. 

STAVES
I'd stake my reputation on the theory that Sea Giants aren't magic users. Even so, taking their affinity for bone into account, we can fashion our staves into fearsome imitations of what the Sea Giants' might look like. The skulls of small animals might decorate the top, with larger pieces of bones carved thin like sails to spread out and inspire terror in any unfortunate enough to warrant the wielder's ire. 

SWORDS
Our swords would be mere daggers in Sea Giant hands, but surely even they could appreciate the use of horker leather around the hilt and decorative bone carvings along the pommel. While we may not be jumping into the sea to deliver a fatal blow to a great whale, we can use these mysterious creatures as inspiration during our own battles.
