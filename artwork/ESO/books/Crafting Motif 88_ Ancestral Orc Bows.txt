Crafting Motif 88: Ancestral Orc Bows

By Armelle Menant, Historian of Glenumbra

The Orcs are a proud people, a race supposedly birthed from the strongest of the Elven Divines after he was corrupted by the Daedric Prince, Boethiah. Feared outcasts for most of their history, Orcs—and their mark upon Tamriel—is one that we ignore at our peril! We cannot discuss their history without observing the evolution of Orsinium throughout time. The first iteration came in the First Era when it became a refuge for Orcs under the chieftain Torug gro-Igron. A civilization flourished, and the master smiths of this new nation outfitted their warriors in armor worthy of their strength.

BOWS
The early Orcs coated even their quiver with metal, making them heavier to carry, but near impenetrable as a tradeoff. The visage of Torug adorned the metal at the base of the quiver and the design extended to the limbs of the bows themselves. Pointed metal embellishments protruded from the ends of the bow, not unlike tusks.
