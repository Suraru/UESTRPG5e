Crafting Motif 88: Ancestral Orc Chests

By Armelle Menant, Historian of Glenumbra

The Orcs are a proud people, a race supposedly birthed from the strongest of the Elven Divines after he was corrupted by the Daedric Prince, Boethiah. Feared outcasts for most of their history, Orcs—and their mark upon Tamriel—is one that we ignore at our peril! We cannot discuss their history without observing the evolution of Orsinium throughout time. The first iteration came in the First Era when it became a refuge for Orcs under the chieftain Torug gro-Igron. A civilization flourished, and the master smiths of this new nation outfitted their warriors in armor worthy of their strength.

CHESTS
Shimmering bronze metal featured heavily in Orcish breastplates. Thin plates of metal laid against the wearer's chest, tight to the body and tapered. A menacing depiction of Turog gro-Igron glowered on the front, striking fear into the heart of any who dared oppose the wearer.
