Crafting Motif 88: Ancestral Orc Daggers

By Armelle Menant, Historian of Glenumbra

The Orcs are a proud people, a race supposedly birthed from the strongest of the Elven Divines after he was corrupted by the Daedric Prince, Boethiah. Feared outcasts for most of their history, Orcs—and their mark upon Tamriel—is one that we ignore at our peril! We cannot discuss their history without observing the evolution of Orsinium throughout time. The first iteration came in the First Era when it became a refuge for Orcs under the chieftain Torug gro-Igron. A civilization flourished, and the master smiths of this new nation outfitted their warriors in armor worthy of their strength.

DAGGERS
A snarling face roars with Orcish fury at the hilt of even the smallest daggers. The blade curves at a menacing angle, making it an efficient weapon for cleaving through enemies. Subtlety did not factor into these weapons. The Orcs of old had no need for such practices. They sheathed these daggers proudly at the waist as a challenge to friend and foe alike.
