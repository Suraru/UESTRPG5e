Crafting Motif 88: Ancestral Orc Gloves

By Armelle Menant, Historian of Glenumbra

The Orcs are a proud people, a race supposedly birthed from the strongest of the Elven Divines after he was corrupted by the Daedric Prince, Boethiah. Feared outcasts for most of their history, Orcs—and their mark upon Tamriel—is one that we ignore at our peril! We cannot discuss their history without observing the evolution of Orsinium throughout time. The first iteration came in the First Era when it became a refuge for Orcs under the chieftain Torug gro-Igron. A civilization flourished, and the master smiths of this new nation outfitted their warriors in armor worthy of their strength.

GLOVES
Ancient Nedic artwork indicates that the earliest Orcs reveled in cruelty and lived by savage law. Whether that's entirely true, we know from their plated metal gloves that they placed great emphasis on brutal efficiency. An Orc without a weapon still made quite the formidable opponent with gloves like these. One punch from a metal-clad fist could crush someone's face.
