Crafting Motif 88: Ancestral Orc Shields

By Armelle Menant, Historian of Glenumbra

The Orcs are a proud people, a race supposedly birthed from the strongest of the Elven Divines after he was corrupted by the Daedric Prince, Boethiah. Feared outcasts for most of their history, Orcs—and their mark upon Tamriel—is one that we ignore at our peril! We cannot discuss their history without observing the evolution of Orsinium throughout time. The first iteration came in the First Era when it became a refuge for Orcs under the chieftain Torug gro-Igron. A civilization flourished, and the master smiths of this new nation outfitted their warriors in armor worthy of their strength.

SHIELDS
Perhaps the most awe-inspiring display of Orcish metalcraft exists in their shields. For all those who say these Orcs were savage and barbaric, they clearly have never seen the fine carving work they were capable of. A strong Orc helm, complete with a pair of striking horns, features on the shield's face itself.
