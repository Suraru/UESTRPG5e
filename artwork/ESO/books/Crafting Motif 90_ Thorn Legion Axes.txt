Crafting Motif 90: Thorn Legion Axes

By Lendantare, Outfitter Extraordinaire

To the majestic and most gracious Lady Thorn of Western Skyrimâ€”

This letter serves as formal notice that my contract with you is now complete and that I have fully delivered the requested items. I speak truly when I say that your hospitality exceeds that of most kings and queens that I've served. Your servants have shown more courtesy than I expected from those with their nature. It is quite the shame we could not meet in person. I hope you'll allow me to boast that this may be my finest work yet.

AXES
As I entered the glorious Castle Thorn for the first time, I noticed the abundance of bats that lined the rafters and walls. At first, I believed they watched me, but I quickly dismissed such a silly notion. Since they appear to be a favorite pet of yours, I fashioned your new axes to resemble the noble creatures.
