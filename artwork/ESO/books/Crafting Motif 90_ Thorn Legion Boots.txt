Crafting Motif 90: Thorn Legion Boots

By Lendantare, Outfitter Extraordinaire

To the majestic and most gracious Lady Thorn of Western Skyrimâ€”

This letter serves as formal notice that my contract with you is now complete and that I have fully delivered the requested items. I speak truly when I say that your hospitality exceeds that of most kings and queens that I've served. Your servants have shown more courtesy than I expected from those with their nature. It is quite the shame we could not meet in person. I hope you'll allow me to boast that this may be my finest work yet.

BOOTS
Your servants informed me that your many guards shall soon begin a long march into the Reach. Seems like quite an adventure! Such a trek requires the best foot comfort possible. Fox fur shall keep the toes of those fine soldiers warm and relaxed no matter how far they go.
