Crafting Motif 90: Thorn Legion Gloves

By Lendantare, Outfitter Extraordinaire

To the majestic and most gracious Lady Thorn of Western Skyrimâ€”

This letter serves as formal notice that my contract with you is now complete and that I have fully delivered the requested items. I speak truly when I say that your hospitality exceeds that of most kings and queens that I've served. Your servants have shown more courtesy than I expected from those with their nature. It is quite the shame we could not meet in person. I hope you'll allow me to boast that this may be my finest work yet.

GLOVES
Winter gloves must always strike a balance between warmth and flexibility. The thicker materials will keep the heat through the hand but will impede finer movements needed for combat. I believe I found the right balance in these which will keep your soldiers' blood flowing even within the snow.
