Crafting Motif 90: Thorn Legion Helmets

By Lendantare, Outfitter Extraordinaire

To the majestic and most gracious Lady Thorn of Western Skyrimâ€”

This letter serves as formal notice that my contract with you is now complete and that I have fully delivered the requested items. I speak truly when I say that your hospitality exceeds that of most kings and queens that I've served. Your servants have shown more courtesy than I expected from those with their nature. It is quite the shame we could not meet in person. I hope you'll allow me to boast that this may be my finest work yet.

HELMETS
Taking inspiration from the Nords and Reachfolk of the region, I designed these hoods to increase protection against the cold wind and weapon attacks alike. The thick padding resists impacts up to a high threshold. And you'll find the face coverings preserve the sense of mystery that I gather you enjoy.
