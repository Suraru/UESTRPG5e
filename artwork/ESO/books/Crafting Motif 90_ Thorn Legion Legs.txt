Crafting Motif 90: Thorn Legion Legs

By Lendantare, Outfitter Extraordinaire

To the majestic and most gracious Lady Thorn of Western Skyrimâ€”

This letter serves as formal notice that my contract with you is now complete and that I have fully delivered the requested items. I speak truly when I say that your hospitality exceeds that of most kings and queens that I've served. Your servants have shown more courtesy than I expected from those with their nature. It is quite the shame we could not meet in person. I hope you'll allow me to boast that this may be my finest work yet.

LEG GREAVES
Unlike other lesser craftsmen, I know the importance of the legs. Some take them for granted as the meatiest portion of the body, but I see that without proper protection a lucky shot to the knee can easily cripple a fighter. My designs call for strong armor at the joints as well as thick defensive padding. And I cleverly textured the padding for increased flexibility, so they never impair mobility.
