Crafting Motif 90: Thorn Legion Shoulders

By Lendantare, Outfitter Extraordinaire

To the majestic and most gracious Lady Thorn of Western Skyrimâ€”

This letter serves as formal notice that my contract with you is now complete and that I have fully delivered the requested items. I speak truly when I say that your hospitality exceeds that of most kings and queens that I've served. Your servants have shown more courtesy than I expected from those with their nature. It is quite the shame we could not meet in person. I hope you'll allow me to boast that this may be my finest work yet.

SHOULDERS
Such a regal lady as yourself would prefer the soldiers representing her to display the same nobility. I believe the shoulders to be the noblest part of the body. The shape of these pauldrons increases the size and majesty of the wearer's silhouette. Embossed on each piece is a repeating thorn pattern to honor your name.
