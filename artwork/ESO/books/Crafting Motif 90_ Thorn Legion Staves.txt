Crafting Motif 90: Thorn Legion Staves

By Lendantare, Outfitter Extraordinaire

To the majestic and most gracious Lady Thorn of Western Skyrimâ€”

This letter serves as formal notice that my contract with you is now complete and that I have fully delivered the requested items. I speak truly when I say that your hospitality exceeds that of most kings and queens that I've served. Your servants have shown more courtesy than I expected from those with their nature. It is quite the shame we could not meet in person. I hope you'll allow me to boast that this may be my finest work yet.

STAVES
As your forces wield magic to defend their lady, your enemies should feel fear from the sight of the source of that magic. The very staves themselves appear dark and imposing, repeating the same bat motif used elsewhere in the armor. None shall question what grand ruler commands your soldiers.
