Crafting Motif 91: Hazardous Alchemy Belts

To be fabricated precisely to the exacting standards of the unmatched genius Arkasis!

Stone Garden proves to be an ideal location to conduct my experiments undisturbed by the average—by an astonishingly low statistical mode—inhabitants of this bumpkin land. However, it also drastically limits my access to expendable workers. To address the rate of attrition of my now limited supply of assistants, I have developed protective equipment that should reduce unnecessary fatalities and outlast the typical tenure of these peons by a factor of ten.

BELTS
DO NOT REMOVE OR INTERCHANGE BUCKLES, YOU MORONS! They are precisely formed to provide optimum balance and tension for the entire protective ensemble. I do not care if they dig into your oafish bellies!
