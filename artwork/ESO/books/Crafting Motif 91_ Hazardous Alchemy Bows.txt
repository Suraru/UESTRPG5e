Crafting Motif 91: Hazardous Alchemy Bows

To be fabricated precisely to the exacting standards of the unmatched genius Arkasis!

Stone Garden proves to be an ideal location to conduct my experiments undisturbed by the average—by an astonishingly low statistical mode—inhabitants of this bumpkin land. However, it also drastically limits my access to expendable workers. To address the rate of attrition of my now limited supply of assistants, I have developed protective equipment that should reduce unnecessary fatalities and outlast the typical tenure of these peons by a factor of ten.

BOWS
Precise alignment of the layered alloy bands allows for the maximum application of force. Even the slightest deviation will drastically reduce efficiency SO STOP WHIPPING THE BRISTLEBACKS WITH THEM!
