Crafting Motif 92: Ancestral Akaviri Chests

By Caelius Calogerus, Imperial Captain

We halted the Akaviri forces at Pale Pass. I thought that would be the end of it, but none could have anticipated what transpired. The hush over the land as the blood cooled and the Akaviri, hearing the voice of Reman Cyrodiil, knelt and swore to serve him. Now, those remaining raiders are part of our army. They fight alongside us. These are strange times, but we will only weaken ourselves with infighting. I am writing this account to try and better understand these Tsaesci warriors. I think it prudent to begin with their martial knowledge first.

CHESTS

The Akaviri fashion their chest armor from small plates. These plates are laced together in horizontal rows which provides a great deal of protection. To compliment this design, they add metalwork in the shape of flowers and serpentine knots of ribbon.
