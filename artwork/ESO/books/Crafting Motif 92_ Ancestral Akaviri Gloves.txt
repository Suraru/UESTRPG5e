Crafting Motif 92: Ancestral Akaviri Gloves

By Caelius Calogerus, Imperial Captain

We halted the Akaviri forces at Pale Pass. I thought that would be the end of it, but none could have anticipated what transpired. The hush over the land as the blood cooled and the Akaviri, hearing the voice of Reman Cyrodiil, knelt and swore to serve him. Now, those remaining raiders are part of our army. They fight alongside us. These are strange times, but we will only weaken ourselves with infighting. I am writing this account to try and better understand these Tsaesci warriors. I think it prudent to begin with their martial knowledge first.

GLOVES

Many of the Akaviri leave their fingers exposed. Their gloves allow for material to be wrapped tightly across the palm all the way up to the forearm, but leave the fingers free. Most of their gloves have a protective component to them as well, either made from tough hide or some other flexible material.
