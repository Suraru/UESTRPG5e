Crafting Motif 92: Ancestral Akaviri Maces

We halted the Akaviri forces at Pale Pass. I thought that would be the end of it, but none could have anticipated what transpired. The hush over the land as the blood cooled and the Akaviri, hearing the voice of Reman Cyrodiil, knelt and swore to serve him. Now, those remaining raiders are part of our army. They fight alongside us. These are strange times, but we will only weaken ourselves with infighting. I am writing this account to try and better understand these Tsaesci warriors. I think it prudent to begin with their martial knowledge first.

MACES

Whether held in two hands or in one, the Akaviri maces pulverize bone upon contact. Or at least, that's the impression they give. I have been fortunate enough not to be at the receiving end of one. The spikes on these weapons look sharp enough to be daggers in their own right.
