Crafting Motif 92: Ancestral Akaviri Swords

By Caelius Calogerus, Imperial Captain

We halted the Akaviri forces at Pale Pass. I thought that would be the end of it, but none could have anticipated what transpired. The hush over the land as the blood cooled and the Akaviri, hearing the voice of Reman Cyrodiil, knelt and swore to serve him. Now, those remaining raiders are part of our army. They fight alongside us. These are strange times, but we will only weaken ourselves with infighting. I am writing this account to try and better understand these Tsaesci warriors. I think it prudent to begin with their martial knowledge first.

SWORDS

The craftsmanship of the Akaviri swords is truly something to behold. I have been lucky enough to observe the intensely laborious process by which the Akaviri make these incredible weapons. The smith folds the material that creates the blade over and over again until the correct consistency is achieved. Then, they apply a gritty liquid concoction to the sword which miraculously curves the blade. This process is quite long and is made even longer when it comes to polishing the final product. The Akaviri can spend days perfecting these distinctive weapons.
