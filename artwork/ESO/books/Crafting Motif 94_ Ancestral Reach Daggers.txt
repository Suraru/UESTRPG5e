Crafting Motif 94: Ancestral Reach Daggers

By Lieutenant Abrienna Nestoro, Imperial Legion

Reachman warriors are known far and wide for their ferocity in battle and the primitiveness of their arms and armor. Few Reachmen smelt iron, let alone steel, and at its best Reachman metalwork is poorly made. Instead, Reachman rely on materials provided by nature to fashion their weapons: wood, stone, hide, and bone. During Empress Hestra's recent campaign to establish Imperial rule in the Reach, we learned that a Reachman's hide shield can stop a hard-driven arrow just as well as steel-bossed birchwood, and an axe fashioned from the shoulderblade of a Druadach bear can part the links of light mail. Primitive, yesâ€”but effective as well.   

DAGGERS
Reachmen often craft small daggers from stone, chipping and flaking the right sort of rock to expose a razor-sharp, if brittle, edge; almost every Reachman carries a skinning-stone of this sort. Daggers suitable for battle, however, are almost always blades obtained in trade from other lands and finished with grips of sturdy Reach leatherwork.
