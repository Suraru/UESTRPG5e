Crafting Motif 94: Ancestral Reach Helmets

By Lieutenant Abrienna Nestoro, Imperial Legion

Reachman warriors are known far and wide for their ferocity in battle and the primitiveness of their arms and armor. Few Reachmen smelt iron, let alone steel, and at its best Reachman metalwork is poorly made. Instead, Reachman rely on materials provided by nature to fashion their weapons: wood, stone, hide, and bone. During Empress Hestra's recent campaign to establish Imperial rule in the Reach, we learned that a Reachman's hide shield can stop a hard-driven arrow just as well as steel-bossed birchwood, and an axe fashioned from the shoulderblade of a Druadach bear can part the links of light mail. Primitive, yesâ€”but effective as well.   

HELMETS
Most Reachman helmets are fashioned from heavy leather, with interior cushioning of fleece. When more protection is called for, the hollowed-out skull of a large and fearsome animal such as a bear or dire wolf is preferred. Skull and antler motifs are common. Skull designs are intended for intimidation, while antlers honor Hircine, Lord of the Hunt and chief among the Reachman gods.
