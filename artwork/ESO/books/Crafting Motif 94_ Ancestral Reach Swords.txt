Crafting Motif 94: Ancestral Reach Swords

By Lieutenant Abrienna Nestoro, Imperial Legion

Reachman warriors are known far and wide for their ferocity in battle and the primitiveness of their arms and armor. Few Reachmen smelt iron, let alone steel, and at its best Reachman metalwork is poorly made. Instead, Reachman rely on materials provided by nature to fashion their weapons: wood, stone, hide, and bone. During Empress Hestra's recent campaign to establish Imperial rule in the Reach, we learned that a Reachman's hide shield can stop a hard-driven arrow just as well as steel-bossed birchwood, and an axe fashioned from the shoulderblade of a Druadach bear can part the links of light mail. Primitive, yesâ€”but effective as well.   

SWORDS
Reachmen lack the metalworking skill to produce a sword worth the name. Instead, they trade for their blades or claim swords as trophies from defeated warriors of other lands. These foreign-made blades are then finished or refitted with Reach-made hilts, grips, and pommels. In some cases, long swords are cut down or reshaped into heavy, cleaver-like weapons. Reach warriors find it easier to maintain a single cutting edge than a finely balanced blade.
