Crafting Motif 96: Arkthzand Armory Bows

By Mathinn Palard, University of Gwylim

No other people have yet matched the alloys and techniques the Dwarves employed to fashion their weapons and armor. Alas, many of the Dwarven secrets of metal-working vanished from Tamriel centuries ago. Likewise, some artifacts of Arkthzand providence also feature magical crystals—perhaps the "aetherium" mentioned in various mythic histories—whose purpose and powers are understood by no other peoples. Yet with a careful study of the pieces intrepid adventurers have recovered from the depths of the Dwarven ruins sleeping beneath the Reach, we can draw valuable insights into the designs favored in the legendary realm of Arkthzand.

BOWS
It is difficult to call these weapons bows; they are better described as machines in the shape of bows. The artisans of Arkthzand made the limbs of the bow from inflexible metal, but hidden springs of great strength provide the flexing power needed to drive their metal-shafted arrows with tremendous force.
