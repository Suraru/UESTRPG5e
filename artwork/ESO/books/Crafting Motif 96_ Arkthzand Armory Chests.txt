Crafting Motif 96: Arkthzand Armory Chests

By Mathinn Palard, University of Gwylim

No other people have yet matched the alloys and techniques the Dwarves employed to fashion their weapons and armor. Alas, many of the Dwarven secrets of metal-working vanished from Tamriel centuries ago. Likewise, some artifacts of Arkthzand providence also feature magical crystals—perhaps the "aetherium" mentioned in various mythic histories—whose purpose and powers are understood by no other peoples. Yet with a careful study of the pieces intrepid adventurers have recovered from the depths of the Dwarven ruins sleeping beneath the Reach, we can draw valuable insights into the designs favored in the legendary realm of Arkthzand.

CHESTS
A cunningly articulated breastplate of Dwarven alloy, the Arkthzand chest piece is almost impenetrable. Sockets in the pectoral plates hold small orbs of luminous arcane crystal—the legendary aetherium mined in the realms of Blackreach. The aetherium crystals most likely empowered the armor in some way, but the secret is lost to time.
