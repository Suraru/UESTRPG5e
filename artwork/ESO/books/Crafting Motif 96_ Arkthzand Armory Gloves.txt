Crafting Motif 96: Arkthzand Armory Gloves

By Mathinn Palard, University of Gwylim

No other people have yet matched the alloys and techniques the Dwarves employed to fashion their weapons and armor. Alas, many of the Dwarven secrets of metal-working vanished from Tamriel centuries ago. Likewise, some artifacts of Arkthzand providence also feature magical crystals—perhaps the "aetherium" mentioned in various mythic histories—whose purpose and powers are understood by no other peoples. Yet with a careful study of the pieces intrepid adventurers have recovered from the depths of the Dwarven ruins sleeping beneath the Reach, we can draw valuable insights into the designs favored in the legendary realm of Arkthzand.

GLOVES
Compared to most other elements of Dwarven armor, gloves seem surprisingly light in construction. The fingers are left unprotected except for small rivets over the knuckles—most likely so the wearer's ability to work on fine mechanisms would be unimpaired. A small socket in each vambrace holds an orb of aetherium crystal.
