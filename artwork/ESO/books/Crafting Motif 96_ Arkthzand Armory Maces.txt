Crafting Motif 96: Arkthzand Armory Maces

By Mathinn Palard, University of Gwylim

No other people have yet matched the alloys and techniques the Dwarves employed to fashion their weapons and armor. Alas, many of the Dwarven secrets of metal-working vanished from Tamriel centuries ago. Likewise, some artifacts of Arkthzand providence also feature magical crystals—perhaps the "aetherium" mentioned in various mythic histories—whose purpose and powers are understood by no other peoples. Yet with a careful study of the pieces intrepid adventurers have recovered from the depths of the Dwarven ruins sleeping beneath the Reach, we can draw valuable insights into the designs favored in the legendary realm of Arkthzand.

MACES
Like their axes, the Dwarves of Arkthzand fashioned their maces with metal hafts just as tough and durable as the weapons' striking head. In fact, it can be difficult to tell Arkthzandi maces from axes at quick glance; the large, heavy flanges of the weapons bear a passing resemblance to axe blades. They are blunt, however, and maces mount four flanges instead of the two blades found on Dwarven axes.
