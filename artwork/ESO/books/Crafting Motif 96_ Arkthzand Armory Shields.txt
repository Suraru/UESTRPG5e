Crafting Motif 96: Arkthzand Armory Shields

By Mathinn Palard, University of Gwylim

No other people have yet matched the alloys and techniques the Dwarves employed to fashion their weapons and armor. Alas, many of the Dwarven secrets of metal-working vanished from Tamriel centuries ago. Likewise, some artifacts of Arkthzand providence also feature magical crystals—perhaps the "aetherium" mentioned in various mythic histories—whose purpose and powers are understood by no other peoples. Yet with a careful study of the pieces intrepid adventurers have recovered from the depths of the Dwarven ruins sleeping beneath the Reach, we can draw valuable insights into the designs favored in the legendary realm of Arkthzand.

SHIELDS
A large heater fashioned in the shape of a pointed, notched oval, an Arkthzand shield is made from a single piece of nearly unbreakable alloy. The decorative toolwork resembles a highly stylized eye with geometric rays emanating from it.
