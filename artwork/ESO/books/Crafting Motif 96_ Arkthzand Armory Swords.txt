Crafting Motif 96: Arkthzand Armory Swords

By Mathinn Palard, University of Gwylim

No other people have yet matched the alloys and techniques the Dwarves employed to fashion their weapons and armor. Alas, many of the Dwarven secrets of metal-working vanished from Tamriel centuries ago. Likewise, some artifacts of Arkthzand providence also feature magical crystals—perhaps the "aetherium" mentioned in various mythic histories—whose purpose and powers are understood by no other peoples. Yet with a careful study of the pieces intrepid adventurers have recovered from the depths of the Dwarven ruins sleeping beneath the Reach, we can draw valuable insights into the designs favored in the legendary realm of Arkthzand.

SWORDS
Dwarven swords are fashioned from a strange, brass-hued alloy every bit as hard and durable as steel, and more resistant to corrosion as well. The blades are heavy and seem better suited to slashing than thrusting. Likewise, the grips are quite long in comparison to the overall length of the weapon, allowing for a wide two-handed grip at need.
