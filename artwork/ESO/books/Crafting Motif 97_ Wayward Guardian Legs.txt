Crafting Motif 97: Wayward Guardian Legs

By Arana of the Ghostsong Clan (as recorded by Count Verandis Ravenwatch)

As the Gray Host stalks our lands and preys upon our clans, the Despot of Markarth demands we freehands of the Reach come to heel and kiss his feet for the privilege of cowering in his cave of Dwarven stone. Fie on that, I say! But there's one thought the ard has betwixt his ears that's worth heeding: the deepfolk's bones are strong and they litter our lands. We must make use of them.

Though I know not what Dwarves saw in the stars, I've seen how they marked the stone with the signs of our guardians in the sky. If the deepfolk sought the protection of the Witch, Hunter, and Headsman to create their otherworldly works, let us turn that strength against our equally unnatural foes.

LEG GREAVES
Remember we are hunters, not mud crabs. Keep your breeches fastened with only so much armor as you can keep swift in, and leave the clattering and clamoring of your loins for your marriage pacts.
