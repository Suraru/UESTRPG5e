Crafting Motif 97: Wayward Guardian Shields

By Arana of the Ghostsong Clan (as recorded by Count Verandis Ravenwatch)

As the Gray Host stalks our lands and preys upon our clans, the Despot of Markarth demands we freehands of the Reach come to heel and kiss his feet for the privilege of cowering in his cave of Dwarven stone. Fie on that, I say! But there's one thought the ard has betwixt his ears that's worth heeding: the deepfolk's bones are strong and they litter our lands. We must make use of them.

Though I know not what Dwarves saw in the stars, I've seen how they marked the stone with the signs of our guardians in the sky. If the deepfolk sought the protection of the Witch, Hunter, and Headsman to create their otherworldly works, let us turn that strength against our equally unnatural foes.

SHIELDS
Tempted as you might be to strap a deepfolk door to your arm and call it a bulwark, it's liable to outlast your arm. Their metals clamor when struck hard. They'll shake and hum down into your bones and crack them. Lash what you can bear to a wooden shield and cushion the layers with fur and feathers.
