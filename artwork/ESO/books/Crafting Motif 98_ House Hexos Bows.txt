Crafting Motif 98: House Hexos Bows

By Fortis Scaeva, Chief of Operations

Welcome to the service of House Hexos! You now are part of a mercantile empire that extends far into the myriad realms of Oblivion. From our emporium in Fargrave, our agents pursue the goods of a dozen worlds and arrange for their delivery to discerning buyers throughout Tamriel.

Naturally, our enterprise comes with certain risks. This is why we hire mercenaries such as you. Fargrave is safe enough, but our merchants require escorts to the strange realms in which they do business. The best practice is to deter attacks with conspicuously well-armed troops. But when deterrence fails, we must be ready to fight.

Since we venture into hostile environments, House Hexos issues weapons treated to remain useful in storms of ash, corrosive swamps, or bitter icefields. And we expect mercenaries in our service to proudly wear the colors of our house: olive green, brown leather, emblems of deep red. In many planes, our safe-passage agreements require us to identify ourselves. Discard our colors at your peril!

BOWS
Wood is hard to find in Fargrave. As a result, we import our bows from Tamriel. Most House Hexos bows are made from Niben Valley olive wood, treated with special waxes to resist damaging conditions. However, it should be noted that we find ourselves in close combat more often than not in the realms of Oblivion. Archery is something of an afterthought for Hexos forces.
