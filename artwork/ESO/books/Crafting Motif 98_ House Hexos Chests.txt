Crafting Motif 98: House Hexos Chests

By Fortis Scaeva, Chief of Operations

Welcome to the service of House Hexos! You now are part of a mercantile empire that extends far into the myriad realms of Oblivion. From our emporium in Fargrave, our agents pursue the goods of a dozen worlds and arrange for their delivery to discerning buyers throughout Tamriel.

Naturally, our enterprise comes with certain risks. This is why we hire mercenaries such as you. Fargrave is safe enough, but our merchants require escorts to the strange realms in which they do business. The best practice is to deter attacks with conspicuously well-armed troops. But when deterrence fails, we must be ready to fight.

Since we venture into hostile environments, House Hexos issues weapons treated to remain useful in storms of ash, corrosive swamps, or bitter icefields. And we expect mercenaries in our service to proudly wear the colors of our house: olive green, brown leather, emblems of deep red. In many planes, our safe-passage agreements require us to identify ourselves. Discard our colors at your peril!

CHESTS
Strong and closely fitted to the wearer, a heavy House Hexos breastplate consists of articulated plates of browned iron with layers of reinforced leather above and underneath. Browning involves treating the metal with a weak solution of acids before scrubbing away the solution with hard brushes. Between the leather cladding and the browning, Hexos armor can stand up to almost any planar climate.
