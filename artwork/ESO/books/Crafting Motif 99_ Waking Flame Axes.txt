Crafting Motif 99: Waking Flame Axes

Designs by Renowned Master Armorer and Metalworker Edmund Mido

A guide on dressing and armoring the supplicants of the Waking Flame Cult in the fashion to best please Lord Dagon and commit atrocities on the tiresome "innocents" roaming Tamriel. 

These are the accounts of my life's designs and works. Do not make me look like a fool or seek to 'improve upon' my designs with your lesser input. I tailored my life's work to serve Dagon. I crafted each piece to evoke the Prince of Fire and Flame's destructive might. Your ill-advised input into these designs—should you be stupid enough to attempt to provide it—is unneeded and will not even be successful. My work is perfection itself.

AXES
The last thing those foolish enough to cross our sacred order see is the axes of the executioner. Adorn them liberally with jagged points for martial combat as well. If any weapon you create cannot be used to disarm an enemy of our Lord, then you will be carted through a portal into his realm and left for the scamps.
