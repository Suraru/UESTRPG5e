Crafting Motif 99: Waking Flame Chests

Designs by Renowned Master Armorer and Metalworker Edmund Mido

A guide on dressing and armoring the supplicants of the Waking Flame Cult in the fashion to best please Lord Dagon and commit atrocities on the tiresome "innocents" roaming Tamriel. 

These are the accounts of my life's designs and works. Do not make me look like a fool or seek to 'improve upon' my designs with your lesser input. I tailored my life's work to serve Dagon. I crafted each piece to evoke the Prince of Fire and Flame's destructive might. Your ill-advised input into these designs—should you be stupid enough to attempt to provide it—is unneeded and will not even be successful. My work is perfection itself.

CHESTS
Our hearts beat strong for the Prince of Destruction. Protect those organs with overlapping slabs of metal. Fit the chest pieces to the wearer's torso, but leave the ribs exposed. Anyone without the stomach to die in the service of Dagon does not deserve to keep it.
