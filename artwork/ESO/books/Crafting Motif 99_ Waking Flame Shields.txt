Crafting Motif 99: Waking Flame Shields

Designs by Renowned Master Armorer and Metalworker Edmund Mido

A guide on dressing and armoring the supplicants of the Waking Flame Cult in the fashion to best please Lord Dagon and commit atrocities on the tiresome "innocents" roaming Tamriel. 

These are the accounts of my life's designs and works. Do not make me look like a fool or seek to 'improve upon' my designs with your lesser input. I tailored my life's work to serve Dagon. I crafted each piece to evoke the Prince of Fire and Flame's destructive might. Your ill-advised input into these designs—should you be stupid enough to attempt to provide it—is unneeded and will not even be successful. My work is perfection itself.

SHIELDS
The shields wielded by our warriors are made in the image of the doors to Oblivion, which is where the warriors will send our enemies. Craft them with overlapping metalwork with pointed ribs exposed from the sides of the shields. Waking Flame fighters delight in using the shield's vengeful side faces to slam into other combatants, spilling blood for Lord Dagon.
