Crow's Spell of Binding

By the snare of Hircine
And the trail of Namira's slime
I bind this place
Three times seven times

By Malacath's curse
And the skull of Vaermina 
I bind (name of victim)
To this summoning arena

By the razor of Dagon
And the chains of Molag Bal
When the time is at hand
You will answer my call
