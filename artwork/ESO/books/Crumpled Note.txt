Crumpled Note

My investigation is complete as per the Guild's orders. I am providing here a collection of speaking stones from which you can draw your own conclusions. To say that the Empress Regent has been acting erratically is an understatement.

I can't risk exposure any longer. The hearsay is General Velarius is dead, under what circumstances I don't know.

I suspect the Archmage will want to see the content of these devices. I leave the city tonight.
