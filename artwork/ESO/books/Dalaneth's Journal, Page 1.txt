Father led us to the site the spinner described. All I see are shrines to Mauloch, and it looks like the Drublog have lived here for decades. But if the spinner proclaimed this the site of our forefathers, then we'll make do.

The Orcs said other Bosmer used a cavern beneath the village as their shrine. I wonder what other Bosmer lived here? Not much is left of them.

I've been helping Spinner Sandaerion write down our history. He doesn't write, but I learned when we were at the harbor for a time. Scribble, scribble, scribble! That's all I do now!
