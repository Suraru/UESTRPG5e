Dancing Among the Flowers Fine

(A Khajiit Dancing Song)

[Phrasing Style One: Slightly Staccato]
Dancing among the flowers fine
Singing a song that calls to him
Moonlight serenade at my whim 
Dancing among the flowers fine

Sleeping within the dreaming deep
Chasing the butterflies he sends
Hoping that summer never ends
Sleeping within the dreaming deep

[Phrasing Style Two: Each Line Legato]
Vistas unfold before me now
Sharing their secrets joyfully
They're bright in hue yet darkly dire
They warm me with softly glowing fireâ€¦

[Phrasing Style One]
Moving within the worlds between
Following all the gemstone birds
Yearning to hear his whispered words
Moving within the worlds between
