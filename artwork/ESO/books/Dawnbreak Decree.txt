Dawnbreak Decree

Citizens of Dawnbreak

With the upcoming visit of Queen Ayrenn, please be sure that you are current in the upkeep of your homes and yards. 

We will conduct a town meeting to review proper etiquette and dress for the event. I expect perfect attendance and will be taking note of any who are absent.
