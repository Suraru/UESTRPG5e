Distillation Calibrations and Instructions

Do not adjust the netherroot growth sprayer calibrations without proper authorization!

Current Calibrations: (Effectiveness at 97%)
-  Primary Calibration is at 4 Units 
-  Secondary Calibration is at 2 Units  

If a nozzle is accidentally adjusted, use the reset to return all valves to current calibrations and report for appropriate punishment. Do NOT destabilize the mixture! If pure cloud mist is absorbed by the plants, weeks of work will be lost and the netherroot will be useless.

NOTES ON CURRENT CALIBRATION:
Neither of the distillates can fall below 2 units or exceed 4 units. The valves will stop if you try to set them outside these parameters. Attempting to push past these parameters will reset the calibration. 

Remember, the secondary distillate should never exceed the primary by more than 1 unit. 2 units or more will destabilize the current mixture, causing pure cloud mist to spray out. This can result in death. Yours, specifically.

- Reset the calibrations only if ordered to do so, using the console in the center.
