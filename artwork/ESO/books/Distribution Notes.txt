Distribution Notes

— Need to get more product moving toward Dune. High demand needs high supply.

— Hadran's last shipment went out faster than expected. He's due for a resupply.

— Opened negotiations with Ren-dro out of Pa'alat to discuss distribution overseas. He's sure assets in the Pact and Covenant would be open to extending the network.

— Hosted former Heritance soldiers, talked distribution in Auridon. Still have deep roots in communities, can offer low-level buy-in.
