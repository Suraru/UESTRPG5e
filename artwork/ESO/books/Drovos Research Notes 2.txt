Drovos Research Notes 2

My current employers have seen fit to tether a leash to my neck. It takes the form of Ridena Devani. This so called "sub-Tamrielic naturalist" sees only danger where I see innovation. She cowers behind morals and ethics, like a child hiding behind her mother's skirts. She's already set on holding back my progress. I will have to think of a way to protect my research and my already evolving subjects.

My subjects. They come along excellently! Through mundane breeding methods and my brilliant alchemical creations, they've become hardier and more resolute than any other kwama. An unfortunate side effect causes an increase in aggression, but nothing is ever perfect. I've developed a scent for myself and the workers in order to keep them calm, but still Devani worries that they've become too violent. I'll have to find a way to get rid of her nagging, sooner rather than later.
