Duchess Astella's Notes

Soon, my beloved Mathen will return. But there is still much to do!

The ritual demands that I bury the talismans—his armor pieces—under clumps of heartsbane. The foul poisons of the plant are meant to keep meddlesome spirits at bay. It's just a matter of where to put them.

I will plant his cuirass near the well, so his heart is rejuvenated.

I must bury his helm near the wall, so that he can see what danger approaches.

His shield will rest near the gate, to protect this castle and his spirit.

Lastly, I will place his sword in the care of an ancestor. There is danger here, but I have to try.
