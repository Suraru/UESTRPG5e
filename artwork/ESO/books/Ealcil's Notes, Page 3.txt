Ealcil's Notes, Page 3

Exhilarating! The howling, the lightning—it's all energy drawn to the "Storm Totems" in that cave. But when I tried to enter, those fool Maormer collapsed the entrance!

To any Dominion personnel who find the addled skooma-smuggler with these orders, I seek another way into the cave complex. Approach if you see me about the quay so I may requisition your services in my search.
