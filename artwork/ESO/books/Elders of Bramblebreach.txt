Elders of Bramblebreach

The spinners tell of spirits
to whom this land belongs
and who belong to this land
if they belong to anything.

They are our ancestors
and our governors
our conscience when conscience fails;
wisdom for foolish Elves.

We may pretend to live apart from them
but it is only a child's tale, made of childish dreams.
