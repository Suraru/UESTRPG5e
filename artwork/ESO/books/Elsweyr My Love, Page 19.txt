Tigerius Falco: [kneeling heroically] "My dearest, soft-furred Shashara, your tears break my heart. And my heart is yours."

Tigerius Falco: [stands sadly] "I understand. One as lovely as you should not waste her time on a lowly Imperial soldier. Please forgive me for blurting out my love for you."

Shashara: [reaches out with a graceful gesture to stop him from leaving]: "No, my sweet Tigerius! Your words bring both sadness and joy to Shashara. Stay with this one, please."
