Endarre's Log

It's just the two of us now. We've been down here in the dark for so long … I don't know what day it is. Ostarand is quiet, even as the sounds get closer. He misses Valasha a great deal, I can see it on his face.

We're trapped, as far as we can tell. The doors forward refuse to open, no matter how we tug on them.

I think we may have it. It's taken us days to figure out, but … the guardian constructs in this room contain strange red crystals that glow from within. They look like they'll fit into the sockets near the doors.

With a little more time, I believe we can find a way through.

The constructs. They've broken through. I think this will be the end. Goodbye, Lannessa. Wherever you are. I loved you. Know, with my last words, I loved you.
