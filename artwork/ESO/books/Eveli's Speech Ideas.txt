Talking points:
-	The intense battle! Talk about the explosions, the arrows, the fire. 
-	Make sure to mention everyone by name! No, that might take too long. Too many names.
-	We overcame the odds! We kicked Mehrunes Dagon in his ugly face! (That's good, keep that.)
-	Investigator Vale

REMEMBER
-	Don't talk for too long. Nobody likes a long-winded archer.
-	Smile. But not too much. Too much smiling is creepy.
-	Don't insult any Daedra!
-	Maybe don't bring up Lyranth? Unless she comes. Then maybe don't bring up the powers of the Ambitions.
