Falkfyr's Notes, Page 3

Day 5: I know the truth now. This giant cavern is Blackreach, the underworld from the old tales. I, Falkfyr Snowmason, am the first man to set foot here!

A giant bug found me while I was filling my canteen. After I slew the beast, I hit upon a ruse. I smeared the bug's ichor all over myself. The others have left me alone since. They hunt by smell, just as I suspected!

I think I can actually survive down here. When I return to Solitude, I'll be a legend. They will build statues of Falkfyr Snowmason, the scout who discovered Blackreach!

I will rest now. Tomorrow I will search the Dwarven ruins above for food. I don't want to risk sampling the mushrooms growing everywhere until I must. I've come too far to give up now.
