9 Yad Day 9

Mushrooms mushrooms good to eat
Big and gray they taste like meat
Small and blue a tasty treat
Glowing green they sing so sweet

I can eat all the mushrooms down here. The Great Oom says so. The Great Oom wants me to go south. I think I blink I sink I'll go south.

There was something I was supposed to be looking for but I don't remember what it was. It doesn't matter. All the roots know my name now.
