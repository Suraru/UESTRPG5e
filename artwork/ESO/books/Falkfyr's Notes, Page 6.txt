Falkfyr's Notes, Page 6

Day ?

I am chosen. The Great Oom will make me a spore, and I, Snowfalk Masonroot, will live forever. The roots know the truth. The roots, the ooms, the singing, they're all connected. It runs so deep!

There is a door below but that way is not for me. The Great Oom tells me about the north now, a home both fetid and warm. I can leave my treasures there because I won't need them anymore. I am a spore and soon I will be an oom. I will be all ooms.

Find my home and spread my roots.
