Fascinating Relics

Assistant,

Don't worry. I'm not dead. These petulant fellows are no danger to me. I thought it prudent to leave you this note to let you know. I've traveled deeper into your tunnels. Some of the relics here—fascinating! 

By now you have likely sensed the residual magicka matrix left behind from my teleportation. Intentional, I assure you. Simply employ a claudication using the third rule of resonant harmonics to follow in my wake. I gave a lengthy lecture on the subject just last week. I'm sure you recall what I said, yes?

PS: Don't mind the guar. Some of the cultists became very quarrelsome, and you know how I get.
