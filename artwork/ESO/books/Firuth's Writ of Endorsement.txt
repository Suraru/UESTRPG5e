Firuth's Writ of Endorsement

Esteemed Councilors,

I, Master Firuth, steward of Hanud and lands beyond, do hereby support and affirm Sun-in-Shadow's promotion to the rank of retainer in the Great House Telvanni.

The Argonian's grasp of our playful internecine rivalries shows a degree of perspicacity I thought impossible in members of her race. For this reason alone, she deserves recognition and respect. She will serve the House well in her new role as retainer.

Honor and Regards,
Firuth
Master of the Great House Telvanni
Steward of Hanud
