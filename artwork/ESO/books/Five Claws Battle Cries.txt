Five Claws Battle Cries

We are fragrant! We are sleek!
We are Five Claws and we can't be beat!

Fur and fury!

Be the claw!

We sniff in your general direction!

These are fragrant! I can't wait to hear us shout them in the next Arena match. But we need to practice. Especially that lazy Sugar-Dance. He can't remember his name if I don't carve it into his fur.
