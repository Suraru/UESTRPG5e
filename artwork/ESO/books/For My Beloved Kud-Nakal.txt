For My Beloved Kud-Nakal

You muck within the waters
As I watch from high above
Lilmoth breathes beneath me
But my eyes track only you

The southwest sky beckons
As does your slowly waving tail
You part the water with your hands
My hands carve a totem for you

All is changing
And my only constant is
The wish to lay your eggs
