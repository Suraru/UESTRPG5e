From Regent of Serpentine Stratagems

Exarch Arnoth,

I look forward to your success within the ruins of Skyreach Hold. I agree that a major source of the nirncrux awaits us in that ancient place. Please make every effort to acquire as much of the red brittle as your trolls can extract.

And know that your resolution and steadfast loyalty to the Scaled Court will be remembered.

â€”Regent Cassipia
