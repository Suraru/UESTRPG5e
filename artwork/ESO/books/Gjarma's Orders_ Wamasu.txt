Gjarma's Orders: Wamasu

I don't care how, but I want that drugged wamasu out of the hold and under <<1>>. It should fit through the old Imperial aquifer outside the city walls. If we can't secure our escape route before the ritual completes, we're sunk.

And don't jostle it! If it wakes angry, it starts melting support columns. We don't want the city to come down until after we're gone.
