Grazdar's Notes: Hammer's Bypass

Nobody said I couldn't bring my notes! I bet Malacath hates puzzles as much as I do.

Thag said there was a simple child's rhyme to remember for the first gate:

Four symbols form the key
Of the clans that raised a city
Whose names we honor to this day
Among the Orcs of Iliac Bay

First came those who built her walls
Next is the clan who armed her halls
Third were they who kept her fueled
Last whom o'er all others ruled
