Gripe, Gripe, Gripe

I loathe the stench of these gargoyles. I'm beginning to wish they had assigned me to the Dwarven project. Razak's Gear? Southeast of Hallin's Stand, I think? Dusty, no doubt, but I bet it smells better.

I don't know what <<1>> thinks she's going to find. But if it turns out we can control the Dwarven constructs, it'll be worth the effort. Time better spent than sitting here roasting my backside off.
