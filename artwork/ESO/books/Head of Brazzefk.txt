Head of Brazzefk

Brazzefk was once a Dwemer alchemist of great renown. Legend holds that his search for immortality culminated in a potion designed to turn him into a living giant of stone, free from the failings of flesh. The potion worked all too well, turning his entire body into a statue, immortal but immobile.

Is this the head of Brazzefk? And is he aware of his surroundings? We can but speculate.
