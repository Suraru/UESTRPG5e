How to Pronounce Dwemer Words

By Amadri Drevin, student.

There are many different thoughts on the pronunciation of Dwemer words. I just sat through a discussion with my master and several other scholars. As always, "learned" scholars disagree. A lot. They also love the sound of their own voices, especially when it comes to Dwarven nomenclature.  

After sifting through the Dwemer words passed down to us through history, most notably the names of places, and sitting through that long-winded scholarly review, I have distilled the knowledge to provide a guide on Dwemer pronunciation for other aspiring Dwarven scholars:

How to pronounce Dwemer words:
	- First, inhale deeply
	- Second, drink a full glass of mead or Cyrodilic brandy, whichever you prefer.
	- Inhale deeply again
	- Put four to seven smooth rounded pebbles in your mouth
	- Attempt to say any word you like, but leave out most of the vowels and add extra consonants
	- Emphasize either the third or fourth syllable in an exaggerated manner (even if the word has only two syllables)

Congratulations, you have successfully pronounced a Dwemer word.
