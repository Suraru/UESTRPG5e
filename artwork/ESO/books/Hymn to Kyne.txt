Hymn to Kyne

In darkness, your light shines through,
Warrior Goddess, for you we strike true.

When hope is lost and war rages on,
Warrior Goddess, hear our blessed song!

With a Nord's death, fallen in battle,
Warrior Goddess, guide us through shadow.

Grant us courage to fight and sharpen our swords,
Warrior Goddess, mother of Nords!
