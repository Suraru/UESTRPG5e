I Must Not Falter

I've found him. Hircine speaksâ€”to me!

I must not falter. I must not yield to the injustices I have suffered! Though they all turn against me, I will not give in!

I return to <<1>>. There, in the haunted place where I was born, I shall find the power Hircine promised me! With it, I will forge a new way, a new story!

As I rise, as I tear through the remains of Silvenar's city and self, <<2>> will come to me, Green Lady or no! She will have no choice! For Hircine is my Huntsman, and I his faithful Hound!
