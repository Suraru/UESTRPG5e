Such drama! Such artistry! Each sad scholar cast off their old, boring mask and took on new roles! Daring adventurers, tortured scullions, and fabled heroes!

But alas! In walked a meddlerâ€”a scheming trickster, intent on disrupting the scholars' play! Little did this intruder know that a terrifying fate awaited them!
