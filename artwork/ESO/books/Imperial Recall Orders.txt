Imperial Recall Orders

To All Imperial Troops,

I have been directed to recall all troops under my command to the Imperial City. This order must be obeyed immediately. All posts are to be abandoned; any supplies that cannot be carried must be destroyed.

Failure to comply with this command immediately will result in charges of desertion, no exceptions allowed.

Report to me at the northwestern bridge en route to the city.

â€” Captain Virgilus
