Increased Bandit Activity

Headwoman <<1>>,

While this one understands the guard is needed to help <<2>> recover from the storm, cessation of regular patrols has led to increased bandit activity along the roads.

One can hardly step away from one's stall without being accosted by ruffians. If it is not bandits, it is harpies driven inland by heavy winds. If not harpies, scavengers "mistaking" our wares for flotsam washed up on the shore!

<<3>> has contracted with a pair of mercenaries to help deal with these dangers, but not all of my kin are able to do so. When can we expect patrols to resume?

Patiently awaiting your response,

—<<3>>, Merchant
