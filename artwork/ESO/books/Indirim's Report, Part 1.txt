Indirim's Report, Part 1

Definite evidence of Sea Sload incursion on Summerset. We're tracking one of the vile creatures along the coast to the west of Alinor, near the vicinity of Welenkin Cove.

We ran into a phenomenon that seemed to be not entirely natural in origin. A geyser sprang up, but instead of just spouting water, it also unleashed the terrible sea creatures that have been reported near Shimmerene and other parts of the island, the yaghra. Worse, there were also undead monstrosities among the unleashed horde.

We need to confirm my findings, but I have come to the conclusion that the yaghra and the undead have been set upon us by some sort of Sea Sload magic.
