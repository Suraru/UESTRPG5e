Indirim's Report, Part 4

I took a chance and slipped closer to try to get a better look at the sigils, the pearls, and the cloaked and hooded figure. B'Korgen is definitely combining magic and alchemy to alter the nature of the abyssal pearls. I wish I had more time to study the creature's techniques. I heard the Sea Sload tell the hooded figure not to worry. "K'Tora accomplished his role in the mission, and while his death is regrettable, it doesn't change the overall plan."

The hooded figure slipped away and Miriya and the Captain decided not to give chase. Better to return to Alinor with what we've learned and let the Battlereeve decide our next move.
