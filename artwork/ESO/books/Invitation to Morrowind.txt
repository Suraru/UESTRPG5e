Invitation to Morrowind

Dear <<1>>,

Honored friend, the most-revered and holy Vivec, Warrior-Poet of the Tribunal, has taken notice of your exploits and requests a meeting. Make your way to Morrowind and the great island of Vvardenfell as soon as you can. Look for me outside the town of Seyda Neen. I'll escort you to Vivec City and introduce you to our immortal god-king.

Captain Jenassa's ship to Seyda Neen leaves from Daggerfall, Davon's Watch, Vulkhel Guard, and other cities around Tamriel. Or you can take a boat from Mournhold, Wayrest, or Woodhearth to Vivec City.

Canon Llevule,
Priest of the Tribunal,
Aide to Archcanon Tarvus
