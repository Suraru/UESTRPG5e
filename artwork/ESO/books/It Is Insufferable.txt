It Is Insufferable

She returned. My love returned from Silvenar only to set our lives ablaze.

A Green Lady! Y'ffre knows she is worthy, but why must it mean our end? We were to hunt together! The world was to be our prey, but now she would put down her bow forever!

I have spoken with <<1>>, but she will not see reason. What's more, her betrothed is that simpering weakling, Indaenir. It is insufferable!

Something must be done. I will go to the city of Silvenar at once! There must be reason in this madness, and if there is not â€¦.

If there is not, then I will see it made!
