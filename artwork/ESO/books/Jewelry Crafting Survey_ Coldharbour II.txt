I find the water here interesting - there's an energy to it I don't quite understand. Why am I here? Between the floating bits of jagged rock and the surplus of daedra, I'd wager I have found myself somewhere in Oblivion.

Surviving's been a trial. I've been able to catch some strange fish that have only made me mostly ill. Perhaps this is yet a dream, a long nightmare from which I've yet to wake? If so — whomever governs this dream — I'd prefer handsomer pursuers, thank you.
