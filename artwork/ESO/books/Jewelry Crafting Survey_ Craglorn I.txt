Jewelry Crafting Survey: Craglorn I

Resource cache uncovered: In a cliffside cranny, southeast of Chiselshriek Mine, north of Inazzur's Hold

Something's gone strange in Craglorn. Since I got here, some of the constellations aren't present in the sky. I'm also seeing strange lights on the horizon, so — naturally — I've been exercising more caution than usual.

After all, if something's blotting out the stars, it's clearly large enough to eat me without even realizing it's done so. I'd rather not attract the attention of any such thing.
