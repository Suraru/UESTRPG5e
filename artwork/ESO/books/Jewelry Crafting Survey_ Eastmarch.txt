Jewelry Crafting Survey: Eastmarch

Resource cache uncovered: South and east of Dragon's Hollow, in the cliffs.

Why would anyone live somewhere so cold? Even here, south of the permafrost, my spines tingle in the cold air. I look at mammoths and bears and feel only fur-envy and a deep need to not remember their odor.

I guess it could be worse. I could have frozen to death. But it could be better, too: I could have an actual cartographer working with me, rather than needing to take extensive notes on every location I visit. Why do I do this, again?
