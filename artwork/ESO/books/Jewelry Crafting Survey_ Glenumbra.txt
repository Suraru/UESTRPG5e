Jewelry Crafting Survey: Glenumbra

Resource cache uncovered: On an island west of the Wyrd Tree, between Farwatch and the Shrieking Scar, on the coast.

I will be frank: I can take more credit than usual for this. Lightning struck a supply of kindlepitch I had been ferrying with me on the survey (coastal surveys being particularly foolhardy) and exposed the precious metals recorded above.

Why did I have kindlepitch with me? I HAD planned a violent cordon for my encampment in the event any mudcrab dared approach my provisions. Alas.
