Jewelry Crafting Survey: Grahtwood

Resource cache uncovered: In a recess at the base of a cliff, opposite the Temple of the Eight, up-grade from the Gil-Var-Delle wayshrine. Not far from a suspiciously friendly hag.

Grahtwood's natural beauty is subject to interpretation. For every towering graht-oak, the dense forest features some score or more horrible thing wishing to rip you open and eat your stuffing. Trolls, hags, stranglers, hoarvors â€” all frankly disgusting and unfortunately common.

I would say "at least the mudcrabs have the common decency to remain on the coast," but the hoarvors are everywhere. They may actually be worse, as their hindquarters jiggle when excited. Disgusting.
