Jewelry Crafting Survey: Reaper's March

Resource cache uncovered: Nestled into a cliffside nook, far but due west of Rawl'kha, between Deathsong Cleft and the Do'Krin Monastery,

I would love Reaper's March, intimately, if it were not already so well-travelled. There are roads everywhere here; the Khajiit and Imperials and Bosmer have all done an excellent job — top-notch, really — of exploring this boundary territory to the fullest.

The climate is perfect, really. Plenty of sun, not too hot, not cold at all. The terrain is delightful, of course; everywhere I've been has been a gorgeous vista.

It's just a shame about all these people. If I could buy the province and evict them all, I would.
