Jewelry Crafting Survey: Shadowfen

Resource cache uncovered: In the foothills, east bank of the river, behind a large rock abutment, southeast of the wreck of the Graceful Dominator, east of Percolating Mire.

I'm from Shadowfen. I'd hoped to never come back, but thankfully my close familiarity with the marsh's various waterways has given me free ability to avoid everything I hate that lives here. 

Hoarvors, stranglers, close relatives, I've ducked them all. I'll be leaving as soon as I can, before I am roped into some sap-drinking family reunion.
