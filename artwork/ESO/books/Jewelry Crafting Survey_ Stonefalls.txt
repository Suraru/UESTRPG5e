Jewelry Crafting Survey: Stonefalls

Resource cache uncovered: High in the foothills, between Fort Arand and Othrenis, due south of Ash Mountain, behind the area's lone tree.

I would like to remind us all that the Velothi chose to live surrounded by volcanoes. This was deliberate, and a choice. This was what they wanted.
I have a great deal of respect for a culture that assessed its needs and concluded it never wanted friends. This place is terrible; it's hot, the ash stings my eyes, there are hostile kwama and spiders and shalk and beetles everywhere.

I think I'm starting to like it. Haven't seen a mudcrab yet.
