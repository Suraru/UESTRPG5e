Jewelry Crafting Survey: Wrothgar III

Resource cache uncovered: Just down the cliff from the path to Old Orsinium, as it curves above a view of the sea.

The trees around here leave their needles everywhere. They also leave a dusty film of disgusting tree waste everywhere. I have fir pollen in places I never, ever wanted trees to know I have.

When I get back to Orsinium, I'm going to spend some time steaming in that delightful underground bathhouse. I'd say I've earned it, after experiencing what the Orcs call "countryside."
