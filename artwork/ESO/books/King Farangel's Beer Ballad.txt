King Farangel's Beer Ballad

Here it was Farangel first 
Set foot upon High Rock,
Claimed this land for Gardner house
And built Farangel Dock.

Sent his ships both far and wide
To trade in distant lands,
Cleared the woods for Wayrest town
Above Stormhaven sands.

First Wayrest king, and father of
The Breton noble peers.
High Rock Bretons, raise this toast:
"For Farangel, four beers!"
