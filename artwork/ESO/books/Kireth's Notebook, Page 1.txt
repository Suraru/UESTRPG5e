Kireth's Notebook, Page 1

This notebook belongs to Kireth Vanos, dungeon-delver extraordinaire and somewhat experienced explorer of ancient Dwemer ruins.

Now that that's out of the way, I can't wait to write all about me and my brother Raynor's latest adventure. When we received the notice asking for experts to come to Wrothgar to help the Orc nation, we jumped at the chance. I love poking around in ancient ruins and Raynor loves to tinker with Dwarven relics.

We set out for the location we were provided with bright and early on the day after we arrived in Orsinium. It didn't take us long to determine that the ruins were indeed Dwarven in nature. Raynor is pretty sure this is the ancient site known as Zthenganaz.

We were surveying the ruin exterior, getting a lay of the land as it were, when I, um, decided to leap into the ruins and look around. All right, all right. I promised never to lie to my notebook. Truth is, I slipped. Fell in and landed right on my arse! It would have been hilarious if it hadn't hurt so much. But at least the snow broke my fall.
