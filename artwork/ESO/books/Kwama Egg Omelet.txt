Kwama Egg Omelet

With the Kwama gone all crazy back home in Deepcrag, Mama Aralosi can't get the eggs she needs for her famous omelets. I'm going take this bag and rustle up some eggs. She'll be so pleased, I just know it.

I copied Mama's recipe below, so I know what I have to get:

Step 1: Find a kwama mine—Check!
Step 2: Procure a kwama egg—Check!
Step 3: Get out of the mine alive
Step 4: Crack egg into a large bowl
Step 5: Whisk until the white and yolk combine
Step 6: Add spices to taste
Step 7: Bake and serve
