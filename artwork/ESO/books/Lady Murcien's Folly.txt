Lady Murcien's Folly

(Anonymous)

Lady Murcien was unsound
She thought she was a Dwarf
Scattered Dwarven ore around
From north ridge to the wharf

Put a hissing teapot on
An axle with a wheel
Said it was a construct come
From Klathzgar, true for real

Made some tools from brass and tin
For a "Tonal Architect"
Fired the forge and thrust them in
Her house exploded, wrecked

Donned a suit of brazen plate
With spiral blade on top
Stuck a soul gem in the grate
And vanished with a pop!
