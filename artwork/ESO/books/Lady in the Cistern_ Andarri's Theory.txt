Lady in the Cistern: Andarri's Theory

There's a statue of some lady in the middle of our Thieves Den. She was here when we got here, and nobody seems to know who she is or why she's there. Can anybody tell me who this is supposed to be?

I think she's the Lucky Old Lady. I saw her statue in Bravil, once—I can't put my claw on it, but it feels as though she's the same person. And it makes sense why the matron of fortune would be here, blessing the only consistent source of clean water in Hew's Bane.

What do the rest of you think? Who is the lady in the cistern?
