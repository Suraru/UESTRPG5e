Leave the Dragons Where they Lie

You are right, I do desire the chance to finally end Sahrotnax's miserable existence, but that is a foolish, selfish impulse. Indulging it would only put our mission in jeopardy. We are not Dragonguard. We cast off that mantle a long time ago. Killing the wyrms is not our purpose. If it were, we would have spent these passing centuries flushing them out of hiding and hunting them to extinction. Others have taken up that cause. Leave them to it. Our focus must remain on the Throne.

You've already exposed us to great danger by confiding in this Clan-Mother you spoke of. You should not put your trust in someone who embraces their vampirism so freely. And this talk of claiming the Dragon's power? It's fantasy, Grundwulf. An excuse to justify your involvement. I know your duty is not so glamorous as Dragon slaying, but put aside your vanity and remember why we are still here.

I make for Anequina in two days. I hope you take my words to heart before I arrive.
