Leeza's Bloodthorn Report

Esteemed Leader,

Our camp, in the clearing set between where the water spills from Mire Falls, has already achieved exciting results. 

Not only have we intercepted a dispatch from Aldcroft, but we've also captured a Lion Guard scout! 

If we wait long enough, perhaps King Casimir will wander in and surrender!
