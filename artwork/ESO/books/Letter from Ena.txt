Letter from Ena

Ulang,

Save your "I told you so's" for when we're both safe. Should I have done business with Reachmen just because they offered a good price? No. Did I expect them to turn on me at the last moment? Perhaps I should have, but the answer is still no.

They'll find me here if I stay too long. I'm headed upriver to the camp by the waterfall instead. It should be safer there. Meet me as soon as you can, but please be careful. I think the Reachmen have their eyes set on Dragon Bridge.

Ena
