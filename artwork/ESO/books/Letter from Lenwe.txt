Letter from Lenwe

Son, don't worry. I know you were scared when you went down there, but everything will be all right.

Your friend from down the road just got the salve yesterday. Maybe he'll be joining you soon? I know you wouldn't want him to get sick, but I'd feel better with someone watching out for you.

Keep yourself safe, and dream of the Stars.

We'll see you soon.

â€” Lenwe
