Letter from Quintus

Dearest,

Have you made any more progress? Are we any closer to discovering the Eye's location? I've sent you some men who owe me favors to assist you. Just direct them as needed.

Your loving husband,

Quintus

PS

I do not mean to disrupt your process by hastening you, but I would truly appreciate a swifter pace.
