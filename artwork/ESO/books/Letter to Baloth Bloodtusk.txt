Letter to Baloth Bloodtusk

Mighty <<1>>,

I received word that your brother has fallen against my forces at Orsinium. It is a regrettable thing, and know that my grief is sincere. If only he had knelt to a worthy king, he would be feasting and drinking beside you. I know you will agree that if anyone is to blame for his loss, it is King Golkarr.

You and your sellswords still have not pledged your might to this false king, and in that you are wise. I hope this recent news sways your swords in the right direction—toward the true villain.

My offer stands. 

—King Joile of Daggerfall
