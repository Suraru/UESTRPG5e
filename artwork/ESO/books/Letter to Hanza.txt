Letter to Hanza

Hanza,

Your goats won't shut up! I understand why you asked us to deliver them for you. 

We saw Imperial troops nearby and sheltered in the cleft where we once played as children. We should have let the goats go free.

If these beasts continue bleating, though, we shall be discovered. We've killed the loudest, and may need to slay the rest. I hope we have enough arrows.

Otherwise, we will get the herd—by Satakal! They come—
