Letter to Imwyn

Imwyn,

If you're reading this, then I'm probably dead. Dead, or we're laughing about this together around a fire. 

The Stormfists caught me out in the open. I managed to find this copse. I found a tree to hide beneath. But I don't know if I'll make it out of here.

Listen, you were wrong about Aerana. She should be able to find her own way in Windhelm. If she wants to work a job in the city, let her. Let her find her own way.

I tried to bring her the Sigil … but it should be up to her.
