Letter to Isrudde

Isrudde Crows-Watch,

I have it on good authority that your encampment at the crossroads outside Dragonstar deals with unusual goods. Namely, I understand that you sell used armor and weapons scavenged from fallen Iron Orcs throughout the region.

If my information is correct, then I'd like to purchase any items you come across that contain traces of the element commonly referred to as "red brittle." I will pay a fair price in gold for every such item I can obtain.

Please contact me at the Dragonstar stables at your earliest convenience and let me know how many such items I can expect.
