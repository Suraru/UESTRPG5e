Letter to King Maxevian

To his most royal Highness, King Maxevian of Daggerfall,

My king, it is with all respect and humility that I write you once again.

I have served faithfully here at Watcher's Hold since I was old enough to lift a sword. For twenty-four years my compatriots and I maintained our vigil. Our love of king and country remains strong, but morale dwindles, as do our food and supplies. Without relief, I fear we cannot long remain viable.

Your majesty, we beg of you. Relieve us of our honorable duty.

Your faithful servant,
Captain Orrent Retene
27th Frost Fall, 2E 458
