Letter to Leonce Gavendien

Leonce,

Your scheme to rob Fell's Run is brilliant! And using the old, abandoned fort demonstrates the level of planning that has made you infamous throughout the region.

I will gladly purchase the gems from you. Meet me in Northpoint when you have them.

â€”Captain Lagra
