Liquid Silver

Minerals and ores of all types fill Wrothgar's mountains. Gold, silver, ironâ€”they can all be found in great quantities. But there are rare metals found here and nowhere else on Tamriel. One such rare metal is the elusive liquid silver.

Alchemists prize liquid silver and blacksmiths covet it, even though neither has found a practical use for the slippery metal. Yet.

Liquid silver is a heavy, viscous metal thought to have healing or life-prolonging properties. It is also believed to have a severely adverse effect on werewolves. Bolts infused with liquid silver, therefore, are a rare and highly prized component in any Fighters Guild member's arsenal. The Argent Mine in Wrothgar was once a rich source of the rare metal, but the mine hasn't been in service for many years.
