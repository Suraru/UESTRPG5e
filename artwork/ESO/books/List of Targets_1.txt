List of Targets

The following miners have been under performing of late. If they happen to disappear, they will not be missed. I hope they make suitable donors for you. Please, make their deaths quick. I do not want them to suffer needlessly.

Adrid: Drunk, disorderly behavior
Dreva: Stole from the mess hall
Horold: Lazy, performs half the work

A word of caution. The miners are starting to grow concerned about these disappearances. The more you can space these out, the better. I don't want Elle getting wind of our arrangement. Things will end badly for both of us should my wife discover my involvement.
