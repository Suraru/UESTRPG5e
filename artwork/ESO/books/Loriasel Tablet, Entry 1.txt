Loriasel Tablet, Entry 1

Progress! The tablet was worth the journey to <<1>>. Like many of their relics, the Ayleids masked the tablet's secrets with illusory wards and destructive traps to make the slightest divination an exercise in mortal danger.

Less a concern for myself, of course. The true transcription reads as follows:

"Epevoy an anyadena av <<2>>e pado an sunnand.
Can an canomora racuvarima.
Arctane va ceye av <<2>>e.
Malatu ye nemalatuis shauta ry relle asva relleis."
