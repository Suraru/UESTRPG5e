Maelmoth's Final Journal

<The journal contains hundreds of pages of nonsensical ramblings. The final entry is the most lucid.>

No one deserves my masterpiece. No one! Except perhaps someone. Ho ho! A test! Yes, a trial of patience and mental mettle! All great hunts begin with riddles. If they don't, they should!

Mysteries lounge in plain view,
Tiles and levers and ancient pews!
Pews in temples where Dragons pray,
Where some were 'Kil'led and old w'reaths' lay,
Meditate on this a while,
We'll see if you have sufficient guile!
