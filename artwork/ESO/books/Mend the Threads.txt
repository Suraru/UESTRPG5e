Mend the Threads

|acThe Chosen Warrior must become the claw that mends
The Tapestry of Time, should it ever unravel.

To accept such a destiny is a great honor, and a great burden.
It must be done with no hesitation.

The Chosen Warrior embraces the will of time,
their heart filled with reverence and pride.

They protect the natural order
To join with those who have come before.

Know this, or you will not don the mask.
