Message in a Bottle

Take fine flour and good damask water (you must have no other liquor but that). 

Then take sweet butter, two or three yolks of eggs and a good quantity of crystallized honey, and a few cloves (and mace) as your cook's mouth shall serve him. Also add a little saffron, and a little spoonful of yeast. If you put in too much they shall rise too much. 

Cut them in squares and prick them well. Let your oven be well swept and lay them upon bound reeds papers and so set them into the oven. Do not burn them.

If they be three or four days old, so much the better.
