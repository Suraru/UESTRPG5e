Message in a Bottle

Mara, Mara, mother of love,
Watching me from up above,
Guide my beloved to notice me.

Mara, Mara, my heart is pure.
I only need the love-sick cure.
So that we may live happily.

The peddler said this charm would work. I hope he's right. Father will be crossed I had to dump his 540 Reserve. But I needed the bottle!
