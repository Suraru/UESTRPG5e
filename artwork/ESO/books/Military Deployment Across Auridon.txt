Military Deployment Across Auridon

Battlereeve Rolancano,

The following are the current numbers mustered to maintain order during Queen Ayrenn's sojourn through Auridon. As our logistics expert, Battlereeve Urcelmo, asked me to send you the following numbers to ensure we have adequate coverage. We know you are still mourning, but Urcelmo and I both value your judgment in these matters.

Royal Guard: First Auridon Marines
Leader: Battlereeve Urcelmo
Total numbers throughout Auridon:
— 20 officers
— 278 soldiers

Queen Ayrenn's Escort
Leader: Battlereeve Urcelmo
— 4 officers
— 20 soldiers
Civilians:
— High Kinlady Estre
— High Kinlord Rilis
— Prince Naemon
— Advisor Norion
— Steward Eminwe
— Attendants and Retinue (5 persons)
— 15 servants
Notes:
Will resupply at Vulkhel Guard, Skywatch, and Firsthold.

Firsthold: Local Guards
Leader: Guard Captain Viranssare
— 10 officers
— 50 soldiers
Civilians:
— 100 

Skywatch: Local Guards
Leader: Guard Captain Torinn
— 8 officers
— 45 soldiers
Civilians:
— 80

Vulkhel Watch: Local Guards
Leader: Watch Captain Astanya

— 29 soldiers
Civilians:
— 50

In all cases, should security not be enough, we can use reinforcements from the Fighters Guild. Though they're neutral in the Alliance War, they still accept contracts to bodyguard. Each city has an adequate Guildhall. There is potential use for the Mages Guild as well should numbers still be low. It's always good to have spellslingers at our backs.
