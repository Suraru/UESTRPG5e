Morgane's Guild Orders

Warder Morgane,

Mages in Leyawiin commissioned us to investigate the strange Daedric edifices in Blackwood. While we don't know the precise number of "doomvaults" present in the region, we do know the location of one: deep in the marshes east of Gideon. The area is largely uninhabited, but a local Argonian reported strange, industrial noises coming from within the structure.

You and Khud af-Hadajja must enter this Doomvault Porcixid and discover what its foul residents might be plotting. We can assume that cultists and perhaps even a few Daedra are present. If you and Khud find yourself separated, remember to use your sending stone to arrange a withdrawal.

For the Fighters Guild,
Steward Bolvus Dals
