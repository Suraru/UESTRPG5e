Morkuldin's Final Delivery

Skalg, 

This is my last shipment. The wrong eyes are on me now. I thought nobody would notice petty thieves and street scum going missing, but I was wrong. You'll need to find some other means of feeding your forge.

This last shipment will include the following:

Four Orcs: healthy
Two Khajiit: possibly diseased
Three Bretons: frost-bitten
Two Elves: one healthy, one corpse

Sorry about the dead one. Couldn't be helped. But you mentioned Elven blood last time, so I left the corpse in with the rest.

As always, I expect a full delivery of Morkul-forged arms and armor delivered to the usual place.

Threads guide you, my friend.
