Mustn't Forget

If that's all that's left to me. I cannot leave it behind.

If I make others as I have been made, it shall be an heirloom of my new house, my new family.

But I must protect it, it must be hidden. What if I forget where I hide it, if the changes affect my mind? Perhaps a clueâ€¦.

Up above, the statue wards. There.
