My Kwama Journal, Page 1

Although my father mocked my desire to study the kwama, I know that I have chosen well. I can't believe he called these fascinating creatures mere insects. 

The Great Houses might be scandalized to be compared to thriving kwama colonies, but these elegant creatures certainly remind me of the best of the Houses. They work in harmony. They share common goals. They have ranks and status, much as House operatives do. All their efforts reflect upon their queen, as House retainers and kinsmen reflect on their grandmaster.

I hope to catch a glimpse of a kwama queen before too long.
