My Kwama Journal, Page 2

I acclimated, as kwama miners do, and these wonderful creatures have accepted me into the hive. I observe their behavior and even try to move like a kwama. 

Yesterday I sat quietly and a scrib sat next to me, letting me stroke it. The moment was interrupted by Harvyn, who scooped up the scrib and hurried off. He gave me a nasty glare. 

I know the miners find my habits strange, but I feel it is important to try to be a kwama so that I can fully understand them. My hope is to be so accepted by them so I can safely visit the queen.
