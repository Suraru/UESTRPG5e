Naliara's Notes, Day 2

Just begun and we've already landed a solid lead. We stopped at the cottage of an Academy sponsor—some connection of Mehdze's—and when he heard Mehdze's proposal for his performance our host lead us to a very curious monument in his collection.
—
It was a weathered coral monolith from King's Haven Pass, about waist high, inscribed with Elven script. Our host said it was a waymarker used by Elves many centuries ago.
—
Mehdze nearly frothed at the mouth when he saw it—he could see the Elven word for "Goblin" as clear as day. I'm excited as well—it's a good omen for our journey.
—
Mehdze complained upon retiring that our host's mattresses—fine things, stuffed with down—were too firm. How is he going to fare in the crags?
