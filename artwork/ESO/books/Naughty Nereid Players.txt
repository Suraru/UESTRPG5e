Naughty Nereid Players

Gather all and listen well! The Naughty Nereid Players have come to town!

For the cost of a few paltry pieces of gold, you can witness the daring, the audacity, and the bawdy portrayal of your favorite tales—performed as only the Naughty Nereid Players can play them.

Marvel at the tempting Tilwen, the wanton woman of a thousand faces—each more beautiful than the one before!

Drool over the magnificent mountain of a man, the Torrid Torolon. His very gaze has been known to melt the hearts of men and women alike!

Be mesmerized by the mysterious Ritabeth, the exotic and vivacious vision forged in the burning sands of Hammerfell.

The Players promise to perform all your favorites, including "Netches, Netches, All Around," "Brave Little Scrib," and "Pesoris and the Argonian Maiden."
