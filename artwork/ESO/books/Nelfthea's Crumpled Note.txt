Nelfthea's Crumpled Note

Magreta, I can't just leave. Not yet. The raid is tomorrow. If we left the captain short two hands they'd barely be able to shove off, let alone mount a raid. Supplies are low. They're going to starve. I don't want to keep doing this either, but we've been with this crew for years. We owe them better than to leave them to starve.

Don't do anything rash. Let's just do this last raid, collect our shares, and wander off while the Frostbite are deep in their spoils. All right?
