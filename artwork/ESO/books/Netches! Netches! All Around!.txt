Netches! Netches! All Around!

By Anonymous

Netches! Netches! All Around!
They're born up high,
And never come down.

Netches! Netches! All Around!
Bulls and betties
Some blue, some brown.

Netches! Netches! All Around!
Their tentacles hang
Like a dressing gown.

Netches! Netches! All Around!
They sneak up on you
without a sound.

Netches! Netches! All Around!
You cannot hide,
You will be found.
