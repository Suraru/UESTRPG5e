Note about "Wood Elf Etiquette"

Glardel,

My contact in Haven confirmed it. Fifty copies of the long discredited "Wood Elf Etiquette: An Imperial Perspective" arrived today. Their destination? The Altmer Embassy. They is what they think of us—flatulent bumpkins who fly into a rage if we see anyone trod upon a flower.
