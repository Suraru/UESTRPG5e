Note from Gullveig

Thorulf,

I trust this note finds your dealings in Fullhelm near fruition. My business in <<1>>  is nearly concluded. <<2>> has no talent for our peculiar arts, but he's capable enough in his own fashion.

Once I've settled matters, I'll move to Lost Prospect to complete my ascension. I may call on you afterwards for … hospitality.

Yours & c.,

Gullveig
