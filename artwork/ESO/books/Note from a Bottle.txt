Note from a Bottle

Drawn to the eagle on my bottle, were you?

Perhaps you appreciate the Eagle and would help it soar. Perhaps you will meet me and help the Queen's eyes see true. The eagle's eyes watch the main road into this den of iniquity.

Perhaps I've had too much Gossamer Tawny Port and should stop making obscure metaphors.

Anyway, find me if you can decipher this message. But rememberâ€”please don't mention this note. I hate these commonplace espionage tropes with a passion and it would just make me cross.
