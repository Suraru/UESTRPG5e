Note to Barkeep

Barkeep,

I did my part. This place was full last night. They drank, you made your bit, so I expect full payment. I'll be staying with a girl I met. She has a cottage just north of someplace called "<<c:1>>." At first I thought she was talking about your ale.

Deliver my money to Sweetbreeze Cottage or I'll never play your establishment again.
