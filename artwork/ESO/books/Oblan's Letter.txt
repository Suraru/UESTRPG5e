Oblan's Letter

My dear, lucky friend Oblan,

Your captain's patriotic foolishness has drawn you the best possible assignment! Imagine, "scouting" for the navy around <<1>>! You'll hit the sands long before any of those officious marine thugs have time to look around.

I'm sure you know, most of my supplies come from KR. Since you don't have to pay "shipping fees," you old sea-cat, I expect you to cut me a deal next time you're in H. I'll have a new batch waiting for you, so be sure to get me my raw materials.

Better keep this short—I hear you're sailing with the tides. Best of luck and a safe voyage to you!
