Ode to Ethrandora

O Ethrandora,
I do adore ya

Your tresses, so red
Look fair on your head

Your smile is so sweet
Like the sweetest guar meat

O Ethrandora,
My heart is for ya

A look from your eyes
Fills me with sighs

When I hear your giggle
My heart does a wiggle

O Ethrandora,
Let me bask in your aura

Your Brelan
