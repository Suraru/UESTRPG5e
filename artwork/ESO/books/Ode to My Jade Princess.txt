Ode to My Jade Princess

An Orc Love Poem by Borasad

My sweet, my blade, my lady love.
Your pommel fits my hand like an armored glove!

I promise to never let our attraction dull,
Even when we've crushed his skull!

My lady love's figure like a statue from marble hewed,
Just the sight fills me with a lust for you.

Our blade of love need never sharpen,
While we cuddle behind the curtain darken!

With your keen love ever near,
My heart never knows the touch of fear!
