Ode to Oinkers

by Littrek

Pink Piggy Friends!
Grunt and squeal and dig.
Do your best today.
For tomorrow you will be in my tummy.

Why do you taste so good, Piggy Friends?
How does Mother's cookpot transform you?
One day you stink of dirt.
The next, you smell like the fields of Sovngarde.

Never change, Piggy Friends.
As sisters change and grow bossy.
As mothers nag and push.
As fathers moan and grumble.
Remain like you are.
Delicious.
