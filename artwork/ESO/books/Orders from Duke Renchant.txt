Orders from Duke Renchant

Captain Hjurrun,

It is imperative that we move forward and transition the city to Imperial control immediately. I regret to inform you that your hero from the lighthouse, <<1>>, has been asking questions and regrettably, does not seem to share our convictions. Though I would prefer to avoid shedding any blood in the transfer of power, I would urge you to act quickly and decisively should your friend try to intervene. Remember that we do this to save the city. 

Gods be with you,

Duke Renchant
