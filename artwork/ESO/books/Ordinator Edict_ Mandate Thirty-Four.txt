Ordinator Edict: Mandate Thirty-Four

Let it be known:

Destroying, moving, or otherwise vandalizing Temple property is a grievous sin. Temple icons and structures serve as extensions of the Tribunal's divine authority. Any assault on said icons and structures is considered an assault on the Tribunal's divine personages. Such an assault carries a penalty of death, followed by Rites of Forgetting and disposal of remains in the Pyres of Purification. Behold the price of blasphemy.

Victory for the Three,

Inquisitor Nivos Uveran
