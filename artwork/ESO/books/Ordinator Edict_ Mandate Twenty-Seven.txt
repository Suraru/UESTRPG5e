Ordinator Edict: Mandate Twenty-Seven

Let it be known:

All bardic song and verse intended for public performance must first be approved by the Ministry of Doctrine and Ordination. Any work that is deemed heretical shall be confiscated and destroyed in the Pyres of Purification. Failure to submit said work for inspection shall result in fines and possible corporal reeducation. Such is the price of blasphemy.

Victory for the Three,

Inquisitor Nivos Uveran
