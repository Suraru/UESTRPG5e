Ostarand's Diary

Everything I did, everything I had to do at Abagarlas. I'll never forget the sight of that place. The feeling that washed across me. The sight haunts me.

The hunters hound our every step. They smell it on me, I know it. They know I was there. They can smell the blood of that dark family on my armor. I can hear them in the night. I pray to the Sunburst that we will soon find shelter.

This ruin seems as good a place as any. If we can find a safe place to hide the crystal, perhaps the constructs will allow us to escape the dead.

<<1>> told me she plans to sacrifice herself for some ludicrous plan, some fantasy that <<2>> has filled her head with. The crystal is lost, its power gone. I've argued with <<2>> for hours. Now <<1>> won't even speak to me.

<<1>> finally broke the silence. She's adamant that this must happen. I understand her duties as a priestess of Meridia, but I never believed they'd lead her to self-sacrifice. Her beliefs come first. I cannot fault her for that. 

I just wish our story wasn't going to end this way.
