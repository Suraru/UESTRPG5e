People I Hate

Everyone on this list is gonna get exactly what they deserve as soon as I find them alone.

Jararr
Goes around telling people I dilute my potions with sewer runoff. So what if I do?

Rellicus Sibassius
Saw him holding his nose and laughing with his idiot friends when I walked by. Still getting friends' names.

An-Medul
Inconsiderate mud-hugger! Ate the last bit of skeever stew before I got my bowl.

Beording Bearfriend
Gave me that LOOK across the bar at the Fussy Guarherd. He'll know which one I'm talking about. Thinks he's better than me. We'll see!
