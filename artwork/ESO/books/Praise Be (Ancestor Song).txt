Praise Be (Ancestor Song)

(Music: deliberate and stately)

Praise we now Mara
O Goddess of Love
Bless us with children
Our mother above

CHORUS 
Clap hands in praise
Exalt the Divines!
Clap hands and praise
Our ancestral lines!

Praise we now Xarxes
Who transcribes our story
Honor the scrivener
Archivist of glory 

CHORUS

Praise we now Y'ffre
O first Ehlnofey
God of the forest
Earth Bones showed the way

CHORUS

Last praise Auri-El
Forefather of all
Formed us to be like him
Wise, noble, and tall

CHORUS
