Ralion's Journal, Day 147

… came back today, staring at <<1>> like a slab of ripe mammoth. When it left, he followed it. Madness!

He's been on edge since he returned. Can't say I blame him. Those eyes bore right into you. Sometimes I dream about them, watching the camp, watching me. If what they say about this place is true ….

Someone dug up Lowindor's grave. The body's gone. Maybe that wolf's to blame, but it's the strangest thing. There were finger marks in the dirt. If I believed it were possible, I'd say he dug his way out.

<<1>> is giving <<2>> a hard time again. I need to find a way to separate those two.
