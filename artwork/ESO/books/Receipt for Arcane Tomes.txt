Receipt for Arcane Tomes

Mistress Gimbert, Felicitous Greetings

This letter serves to acknowledge receipt of your shipment of my latest order of books, to wit: 

-	The Five Points of the Star
-	Sacred Rites of the Stonechewers
-	Twin Secrets
-	Relics of St. Veloth
-	Cheeses of Tamriel

The last item on the list came as something of a surprise. Checking my records, I see that the fifth book should have been "Boethiah and Her Avatars." I understand it is easy to make such an oversight, but I would appreciate it if you could rectify the error at your earliest possible convenience. 

Yours in Arcane Scholarship, 

Lady Cinnabar
Tower of the Fifth Doctrine
