Red Mountain Drinking Song

It sleeps like a giant, our tower of stones,
Red Mountain, Red Mountain, all rumbles and moans.
It tosses and turns, pray it won't wake,
And then without warning the ground starts to shake!
As the world ends, the ground starts to shake! So—

Heft a flask and say a prayer,
Red Mountain's about to explode.
Have a drink but be aware,
It's doom the mountain forebodes.

Lift a glass and curse the day,
Red Mountain's about to burst.
Drink all your cares away,
Who wants to die with a thirst?
Die with a thirst!

Knock back a fiery flin, amid the smoke and ash.
Drain the flask of whiskey we'll be drunk in a flash!
Let's guzzle sujamma amid the fire and fumes
Tip back the jar of liquor let inebriation bloom!
As the world ends, let inebriation bloom! So—

Heft a flask and say a prayer,
Red Mountain's about to explode.
Have a drink but be aware,
It's doom the mountain forebodes.

Lift a glass and curse the day,
Red Mountain's about to burst.
Drink all your cares away,
Who wants to die with a thirst?
Die with a thirst!
