Redfur Journal, v. 2

13 Mid Year

The business of unloading my equipment has been completed, and I have sent the porters on their way. They will return on the first of Sun's Height with supplies, but I am finally alone with my thoughts.

14 Mid Year

From what I can discern, reports of the ruins' dormancy have not been exaggerated. It has all the aesthetic appeal of an ancestor tomb without the company of necromantic constructs sweeping the halls clean of filth.

Really, the state of these ruins is appalling. It's as though my predecessors made no effort to sift through the filth! I will set to work at once.

20 Mid Year

Happened across several enchanted tomes today. Unfortunately, I have been unable to open them. If I had my calcinator, I might be able to analyze their enchantments more closely by taking a sample and breaking it down. Unfortunately, those twice-cursed bandits have made that impossible.

Not to be deterred, I sought to pry up the bindings of one of the books. When I did this, it heated up measurably until it seared my fingertips. Further study will have to await my return to the Crystal Tower.

23 Mid Year

While sifting through the remains of some remarkably well preserved flesh monstrosity, I felt a breeze issuing from the stacks. It was steady and warm, like the breathing of some great beast.

Doubtless it is the ingress to some hidden passage, but its means of access are impeccably obscured.

27 Mid Year

Success! I was able to effect the opening of the passageway through careful application of alteration spells! Such a clever solution will surely draw the admiration of my peers in Summerset, but for the moment, true discovery awaits! It is time to discover what secrets this Reliquary holds!
