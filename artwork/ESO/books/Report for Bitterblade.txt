Report for Bitterblade

Mistress Bitterblade, 

You hired me for a discreet look at your operations in Dusktown. <<1>> in particular. For the past few weeks I've played the dumb Orc, working beside him. I can report with confidence that he is playing you for the fool. This week he sent me out to survey new locations for a mine. Below is a list of the ores I recovered. I would advise you to carefully compare my list to whatever results he delivers to you. I will be amazed if they match, if he lists them at all.

I think I have gathered enough facts for you to make your own decision.
