Restored Tablet

|ac These are the words
|ac And the words are true
|ac The stones only part
|ac When you say the name
|ac Of the one who rests within

|ac Remember his Kra'jun
|ac For they surely remember him
|ac Anequina Sharp-Tongue
|ac Nurarion the Perfect
|ac Flinthild Demon-Hunter
|ac Even the Betrayer

|ac Who rests within?
