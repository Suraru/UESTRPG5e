Royal Messenger's Fate

Sir Marq,

The <<z:1>> of "High-King Emeric" is dead. It happened during the transfer. The wall crumbled and a troll grabbed the messenger. He was dead before he knew what was happening.

A High King allowing Orcs to rebuild Orsinium seems a great lie, but the messenger would not alter his story despite repeated questioning. With the messenger now dead, is there any hope of honorably ending our service?

What hope is there for us now?

Vigilance eternal,
Sir Emmath
