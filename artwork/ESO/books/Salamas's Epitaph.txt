Salamas's Epitaph

Who can recount the tales
of the exiles laid afresh
in coffins claimed from unflinching bones
last resting place for tired flesh?

Here lie weeping men
and women torn from homes
forgotten but not lost
in halls that became their tombs.

Until the last stone is removed
and the prison unsealed
who will sing the mourning hymn
of kings' cruelty revealed?
