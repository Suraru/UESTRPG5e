Savage Sons War Chant

Baloth! For Baloth!
We march come day or night.
No foe can withstand us!
We're terrors in a fight.

Who bleeds for freedom?
Savage Sons!
Who bleeds for their brothers?
Savage Sons!

Baloth! Our Baloth!
The champion we claim.
Wild Boar! The Bloodtusk!
There's glory in his name.

Who bleeds for Baloth?
Savage Sons!
Who bleeds for no other?
Savage Sons!

Baloth! Friend Baloth!
He pulled us from the snow.
The exiled! The clanless!
More savage than you know.

Savage Sonsâ€”charge!
