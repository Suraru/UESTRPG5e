Scaled Court Communique

To my spy in Dragonstar,

Do not reveal your true allegiance, no matter the circumstances. I need you to continue to watch the activities of the Dragonstar Caravan Company, as they have sufficient forces to cause problems for us should they decide to take action.

I have also heard about a High Elf named Elanwen. She has been purchasing large quantities of the precious nirncrux and hampering our own collection efforts. Find out how much she knows about our plans.

I will be inspecting our forces at the Fearfangs Cavern, west of the town of Dragonstar. Do not disappoint me.

Elska, Regent of Fanged Fury
