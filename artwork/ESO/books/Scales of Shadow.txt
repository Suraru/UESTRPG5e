Scales of Shadow

By Nisswo Xeewulm

Stars in darkness, constellation
Tell us those we must collect
Given to the needed clutch
To be taught the needed ways

Scales of shadow, hands of death
Sithis honored by your blade
To create the needed change
By the blood which must be spilt

You who join the brotherhood
Guided by just one untruth
Remember our nothing words
Look upon with nothing eyes

One day, when your snout is pale
To the swamps you will return
Darkness remains in your heart
For your scales are shadow still
