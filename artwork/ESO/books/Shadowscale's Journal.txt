Shadowscale's Journal

Entry 441: Three Dark Elves killed in Stormhold, and rumors call it our work. Preposterousâ€”the Night Mother gifted none of them with her call.

I'll return to the Enclave when I discover who's behind this.

Entry 442: Just watched <<1>> enter her home. This isn't right. Her body remains at the mortuary.

Going to see what this creature wants, and why it wears <<1>>'s face.
