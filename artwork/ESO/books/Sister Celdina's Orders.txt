Sister Celdina's Orders

Kynmarcher Jynd:

Valkynaz Nokvroz tells me that you are responsible for acquiring potential subjects. If so, you are delinquent in your duties. 

To create Incarnates suitable for Lord Dagon's purposes, I must have more Dremora. I don't care what clan. Remand all prisoners in your custody to the devastator who delivers this letter. And then find more!

Also, some Waking Flame acolytes have gone missing in the Sever, not far from your foundry. Direct your Kyn to make a search of the area. I want them located.
