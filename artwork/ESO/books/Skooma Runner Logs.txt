Skooma Runner Logs

Week 5

L.I.: Completed brewing. Thirty bottles of poisoned skooma, one hundred twenty untainted.
F.D.: Thirty bottles of skooma sent to dealers in Thormar and Arenthia.
Z.M.: Ten poisoned bottles and twenty untainted left for Malabal Tor competitors to steal.

Week 6

R.G.: Malabal Tor scouting reveals potential market expansion, due to distrust of established dealers.
L.I.: Production in Claw's Strike slated to triple to handle new Malabal Tor market
Z.M.: Twenty poisoned bottles scattered through Malabal Tor to further sow distrust of entrenched competition

Notes:

Z.M.: Up the poison dosage on the tainted skooma, we want the deaths to be horrifying, then they'll buy from us.

F.D.: Prepare for raids on competitor stashes, going for complete takeover in Malabal Tor.

H.W.: Word from Elden Root is demand outstrips supply. Potential market for us. May not need poison or coercion.
