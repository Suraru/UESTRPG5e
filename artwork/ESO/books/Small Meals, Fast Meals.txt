Small Meals, Fast Meals

by Runs-in-Wild

Rabbit: Very fast, but delicious. Stew or braise, and sell the ears in town.

Crow: Good crunch! Reminds me of fen hen. Season with bamphor.

Dog: Do not eat in front of allies. Nords take offense, as it's one of their sacred animals. Pet instead.

Cat: Delicious! Again, do not eat in front of allies. Another sacred animal. Take from the street and make sure to hide the tails.

Goat: Everything but the horns. The horns are too tough.

Wharf Rat: Baste in Bile Beer. Delicious! You'll get thanks from sailors, too!

Monkey: So cute, but gamey. Smear on dragon's-tongue sap and baste in Theilul rum.
