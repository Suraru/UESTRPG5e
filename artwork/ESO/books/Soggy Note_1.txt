Soggy Note

Concerning the one who calls himself a trader.

Dobias has been stealing documents, contracts, and other financial records from the Gold Coast Trading Company. We have yet to determine what he plans to do with the stolen information, but profit probably plays a part in his plans. Is this reason enough to want him dead? Maybe.

Code Location: South of the Bank.
