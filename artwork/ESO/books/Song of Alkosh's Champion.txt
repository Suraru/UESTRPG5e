Song of Alkosh's Champion

Halls loom ahead of me
My heart is yet untried
I know it is my destiny
To walk the path with pride.

Guiding winds push behind
Darkness lies ahead
The threads begin to unwind
I must swallow my dread.

Khenarthi's winds will guide me
To brave the path with pride
Lorkhaj's steps will bind me
To follow in his stride.
Alkosh will purify me
To mend the sands of time
His mask will sanctify me
A champion of pride.

I ride the winds cunningly
And never break my stride
I face the darkness valiantly
The lanterns are my guide.

When the threads are all spun
When I've earned my right
I'll stand before the Endless One
And bow before her might.

Khenarthi's winds will guide me
To brave the path with pride
Lorkhaj's steps will bind me
To follow in his stride.
Alkosh will purify me
To mend the sands of time
His mask will sanctify me
A champion of pride.

Holy mask and Path of Pride
Path of Pride, Path of Pride.

I shall mend the sands of time â€¦
