Song of Despair

by Anonymous

The memory of answers torn from fate
The destruction of all who cannot wait.

At dusk and dawn, the Rose Queen rules
While thieves of night still own the dark.

Green Dragon's breath pollutes cloud and pool
As silent spider spins webs that mark.

The broken oath and the traitor's plot,
The huntsman's horn and sharpened spear

Make wishes pacts that come to naught
When madness claims those who would appear.

Life stands death upon its head
As sweet lust joins in pools of blood.

Escape the curse with no tears to shed
As nightmares arrive all in a flood.

Disease and plague are no end of life
When mastered by the harvester of strife.
