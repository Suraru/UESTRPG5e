Song of the Prowler


Setting sail from Hammerfell,
On one bright and shining morn',
We took the wind o' a bonny craft,
And bore away from shore.
And bore away from shore.

Their captain swore a bloody oath,
His eyes all dark and fell.
"Be ye pirate or privateer?"
I swear we'll never tell.
I swear we'll never tell.

We raid the ships out of Daggerfall,
And plunder Bleakrock good.
But we've friends enough in Haven,
And throughout all Grahtwood.
And throughout all Grahtwood.

Our Captain is an honest soul,
She runs our ship so well.
When asked if we are honest,
I swear she'll never tell.
I swear she'll never tell.

We've gathered plunder along the coasts,
Yet we've sworn that we'll be good.
Queen Ayrenn she never complains,
As if she ever would.
As if she ever would.

But where's our treasure you may ask?
Buried deep or hidden well?
Locked up tight in a treasure chest?
I swear I'll never tell.
I swear I'll never tell.
