Stendarr's Divine Spear

By Ptolus the Bright, Resolute of Stendarr 

Smiting all that is unholy, 

Transfixing it with point and glow, 

Elevates us with its aura, 

Nullifies the wicked foe. 

Daedra, undead, beasts and manbeasts, 

Abominations it strikes down. 

Re-anoint us, stalwart Stendarr, 

Resolute with spear and crown!
