Sumiril's Book, Passage 5

The boy and the land came to love the struggle. Both had been lonely and now neither was alone. But in the process, the builders were injured and killed, even Sumiril who had once been kind to the boy.

And suddenly Ostion remembered who he was and what he had been sent to do. And he found Sumiril's body and asked the land to help him raise Sumiril from the dead.
