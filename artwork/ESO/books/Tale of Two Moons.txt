Tale of Two Moons

As the sky falls white on Elsweyr
When the frost forms on the lake
When the fires blaze in brightness
When old bones begin to ache

Then cats cast off their budis
And fur keeps out the cold
And small moon chases big moon
And tells him secrets old

But then blue skies o'er Elsweyr
When rivers stream with light
When fires die in ashes
When youth again takes flight

Then cats rewrap their budis
And comb out rich, thick manes
And big moon chases small moon
And frees her from her chains
