Tale of the Elements

By Nalae-Polek, Poet Laureate to Potentate Versidue-Shaie

Myn raises his mighty staff
And so lights up the East

Zisa waves her graceful wand
And so drowns the South

Nyfa stomp his boots in anger
And so rumbles the North

Ilni flutters her colorful fan
And so blows toward the West
