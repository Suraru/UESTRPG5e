Tharayya's Journal, Entry 15

There was a plethora of leads here. Nothing closer to hinting at the Guardian Eye's true nature, but we can figure that out once we find it.

However, all our clues point to Volenfell, the famed Dwemer ruins, as the Eye's final resting placeâ€”and Volenfell's location has been lost for generations. The only thing experts can tell, myself included, is that Volenfell is hidden somewhere under the sands of the Alik'r Desert.

Should be no problem for me and my team to cover its vastness and find those ruins.

Right.

That's sarcasm, in case posterity bothers with this journal.
