Tharayya's Journal, Entry 16

Dwemer records I've found might be able to help us locate Volenfell's actual location. If that was not luck enough, rumor has reached my team that unexplored Dwemer ruins may have been unearthed by changing winds here in the desert.

If these new ruins match up with my records, we may yet find the Guardian's Eye.
