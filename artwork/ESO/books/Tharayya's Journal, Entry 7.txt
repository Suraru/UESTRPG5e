Tharayya's Journal, Entry 7

We've made it safely to Aldunz. There are dozens of active Dwemer devices here. It's a bit eerie. I've never seen so many of them at once.

I've tripped over one of the spiders already, spraining my ankle. I'm told it'll heal, but I wrote Quintus to let him know. The fool couldn't do anything about it even if he were here â€¦.

We have yet to find mention of the Guardian's Eye here, but I haven't given up hope. We can't lose the trail now.
