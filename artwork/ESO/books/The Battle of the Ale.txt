The Battle of the Ale

I won the battle of the cup today,
I won the battle of the cup!
I raised it up, 
And drank it down—
I won the battle of the cup!

I won the battle of the jug today,
I won the battle of the jug!
I raised it up, 
And drank it down— 
I won the battle of the jug!

I won the battle of the barrel today,
I won the battle of the barrel!
I raised it up, 
And drank it down—
I won the battle of the barrel!

I lost the battle of the ale today,
I lost the battle of the ale.
I drank it up,
It put me down—

I lost the battle of the ale ….
