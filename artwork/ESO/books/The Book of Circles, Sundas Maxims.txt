The Book of Circles, Sundas Maxims

By Frandar Hunding

Thus on Sundas, Faithful Ones, do we consider these maxims of the Master:

"Be as dawn to your ally, and set dusk upon your foe."

"The Four-Hundred and Fifth Strike: the serpent's right fang as it pierces the eye."

"When swarmed by flies, favor the flat over the edge."

"Anger is a crack in the hull that sinks the ship."

"First blood matters less than last breath."

"Journey many and many miles, but do not leave the Hall of the Virtues of War."

"Discover your foe's habits and discard your own."

"Do not lose the melody in the rapture of one triumphant note."
