The Book of Circles: Forging Maxims

By Frandar Hunding

In the clay smelter you shall build a charcoal fire, of a heat to blacken teeth.

You shall add a layer of iron-sand upon the charcoal. 

After six yarbans you shall add a layer of charcoal atop the iron. 

You shall repeat this process, layering iron-sand over charcoal, for three days.

After cooling, you shall separate the low-carbon steel from the high-carbon steel. 

You shall use the low-carbon steel to form the core of the sword.

You shall use the high-carbon steel to form the skin of the sword.

You shall forge-weld, fold, and forge-weld anselim the skin of the sword, until it attains its needful kotu-ajcea.

You shall sharpen the sword-skin until it may shave an egg without breaking it.

You shall speak the Oblation to Onsi, then drink of the Purifying Beverage of Kotu.

Then, anselim.
