The Burning of Senchal

Though the sun shines down on me
The darkness years ago makes me weep.
And after flames devoured their breath,
I stood above, mourning all that death.
What then became of me?
I cannot say.

As the moons shone down on me,
I chose to follow an ill-made path.
Staring from a starlit sky,
Moons' stark radiance witnessed them die.
What then became of me?
I dare not say.

We must survive, despite the ravages of life, cruel life
With its suffering and injustice
As death surrounds us.
But can we thrive when all hope has fled before us?
All that's left is grief and shallow graves.
The march of darkness goes on.
What can we do? We just survive.

Decades later who are we,
And after that dire crucible of death?
Did we pay too high a price
To walk away, knowing all we know?
What then became of us?
No one should say.

We have survived, despite the ravages of life, cruel life
With its suffering and injustice
When death hounded us.
But can we thrive after what we paid to get here?
Who are we now? We dare not say.
The march of darkness goes on.
What can we do? What have we become?
