The Coldharbour Compact

Poor Gil-Var-Delle we still recall
The God of Schemes consumed it all

To Coldharbour went Clockwork God
To bargain on the Princes' sod

They came to mock at Tribune small
Came Schemer, Hunger, Hunter, all

Scryer, Pariah, Destroyer came
And Raver and Twilight just the same

From dread Daedra save us
From Daedra keep us safe
Forsake the ones that made us
To fight a wrongful fate

They sneered when Clockwork made his demand
Till Twilight raised a hand

"And what do you offer in return
 "To keep us from chastising Nirn?"

Then Clockwork whispered long and low
And what he said, no mortal can know

From dread Daedra save us
From Daedra keep us safe
Forsake the ones that made us
To fight a wrongful fate
