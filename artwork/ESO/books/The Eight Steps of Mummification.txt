The Eight Steps of Mummification

By Fezmani of the Steady Hand, Priest of Tu'whacca

—	Step the First: Consecrate the body with the Blessings of Tu'whacca.

—	Step the Second: Remove all internal organs before they can decay, causing unsightly stains.

—	Step the Third: Remove all brain tissue. This is to be done through the nostrils using the hook-spoons, so as to avoid damaging the skin of face and head.

—	Step the Fourth: Dehydrate the body by coating it in parch-salt, and placing packets of parch-salt within its cavities.

—	Step the Fifth: Replace lost volume within the body with inert material, paying special attention to restoring the features of the face. 

—	Step the Sixth: The layers of wrapping: wrap the body in one hundred paces of linen, then coat the linen with warm juniper resin. Do this three times. 

—	Step the Seventh: The adorning of amulets: array the body in amulets and bracelets that represent the station of the body in life. 

—	Step the Eighth: Place the body in a prepared sarcophagus. Proceed to burial in the necropolis.
