The Fall of Queen Nurnhilde

Sing the glory of Sovngarde! Sing the story of Nurnhilde!
			Oh queen dear, beloved of Nord and gods,
			You stood against the Akaviri, turning back the vile invaders,
			We wept like weans when your fair head fell,
			But we know you watch over us from Sovngarde above!
			Sing the glory of Sovngarde! Sing the story of Nurnhilde!
			Weep for our beloved queen!
