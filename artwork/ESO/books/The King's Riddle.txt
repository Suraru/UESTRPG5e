The King's Riddle

Where is the armored soldier, tall and brave?
Sword in hand, he lies in the covered grave.

Where is the hunt-wife with axe and bow?
The claws of a bear brought her low.

Where is the knight with the golden blade?
Fighting the monster deep in the glade.

Where is the king on the broken throne?
No knight nor soldiers protect his home.

His table is empty, not even a bone,
The king is sad and always alone.
