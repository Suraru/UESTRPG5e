The Lusty Argonian Maid, A Song

NOTE: A male/female duet, beginning with the male and alternating stanzas.

Crantius Colto is my name
My lusty Argonian maid
I've something here for you to clean
Come burnish now my blade!

I'm Lifts-Her-Tail the maid, it's true
A lusty Argonian maid
But your task is just too much, good sir,
I've never seen such a long blade!

Tut-tut, my dear, that's not what I hear,
My lusty Argonian maid
And Lady Colto's gone to Kvatch
No need for you to be afraid

Nay, I am needed elsewhere, sir,
Though your blade's so long and so hard
I'm needed to tend the instrument large
Of a sultry Argonian bard
