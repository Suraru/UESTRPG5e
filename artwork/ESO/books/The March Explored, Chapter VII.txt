The March Explored, Chapter VII

I will say this for the Khajiit, their architecture is wholly unique on the continent of Tamriel. The beauty of their temples is awe-inspiring to behold. The House of the Dance in Rawl'kha is a wonder.

It's a shame, then, that so many of their greatest monuments are decayed and ruined. So many fine places fallen to disrepair. 

It seems to be a theme across the face of Nirn, does it not reader? Beauty and splendor fallen into ruin over time â€¦.
