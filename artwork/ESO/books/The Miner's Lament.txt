The Miner's Lament

All day long in a dark, dark mine,
Swing your pick time after time.
The sound of metal hitting stone,
We work hard, we work alone.

All day long toiling in the dark,
Hoping the next vein will hit the mark.
A poor man dreams of golden ore,
Our foreman screams, "Dig some more!"

I keep digging and praying to the Eight,
That dying beneath a mountain isn't my fate.
I'm a miner, for better or for worse,
And blood, sweat, and tears won't fill my purse.
