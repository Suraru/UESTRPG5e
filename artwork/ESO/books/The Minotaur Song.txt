The Minotaur Song

Oh minotaur, oh minotaur,
A beast of rage and ignoble glaring.
Oh minotaur, oh minotaur,
None can deny your noble bearing.

Around Imperial ruins you gather,
Eternal guardians with hooves and horn.
What memories lead you to path there,
Is it Belharza or the Empire that you mourn?

Oh minotaur, oh minotaur,
Are you monster, Mer, or Man?
Oh minotaur, oh minotaur,
Tell us how you fit into the Divine's plan!
