Dear Diary,

Today I decided to make some custom templates. I am hoping this will make designing easier for me, or at least quicken my pace when needing to create certain Defs.

Cloning is a really great way to maximize efficiency, and ensure that certain standards are met.

I hope no one other than you, dear Player, can read this. The devs are hard at work to make an excellent game for all of you. Thanks for being a part of the ESO world.

Sincerely,

Game Dev Full of Coffee
