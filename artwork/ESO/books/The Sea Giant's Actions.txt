The Sea Giant's Actions

- The Sea Giant was making camp when I arrived, and now seems to have settled in for the night. Judging from scattered innards and debris, there were local hunters in the area, but the Giant made short work of them.

- The Giant wanders up and down the coast from time to time, but it isn't clear if it's looking for something in particular or simply passing time.

- The Sea Giant has hardly moved for several hours. Seems to be resting. I'll try to get closer, see if I can board his ship while he dozes. I have no idea what it's doing here, but I'm certain that it is completely oblivious to my presence.
