The Sea Giant's Camp

- The Sea Giant's campfire is more of a bonfire, but still not as massive as you might expect. Large enough for one, maybe two Giants to warm themselves comfortably.

- The camp is small, relatively speaking. There can't possibly be more than one or two Giants here, unless the others enjoy sleeping in the snow.

- Provisions appear scarce, relative to what a group of Giants might require. There is enough firewood on the ship for a few nights at most. There is very little food, but it is possible that they planned to hunt after reaching land.

- I believe it's a very small contingent. Probably scouts like us, though not nearly as subtle or observant. I should be able to get a closer look without any trouble.
