The Star-Eyed Bride of Alinor

Eyes of polished amber, hair swept like a comet's tail
Soul alight with love and joy 'neath pregnant golden sails

My star-eyed bride of Alinor
Lost in storm and spray
My star-eyed bride of Alinor
That cruel fate took away

White swan feathers fluttered from her ivory bridal gown
And unsung vows slipped from her lips, eager to be found

My star-eyed bride of Alinor
Gone beneath the waves
My star-eyed bride of Alinor
The sea became her grave

The clouds they gathered overhead, ripping sail from mast
The hull creaked like a coffin's hinge as the captain yelled 'hold fast!'

My star-eyed bride of Alinor
She never made it home
My star-eyed bride of Alinor
Drowned in brine and foam

The lightning crashed upon the sea, the wind howled with the swells
I strained to reach her glistening hand, but into the depths she fell

My star-eyed bride of Alinor
Whose last words were my name
My star-eyed bride of Alinor
I still weep from the shame

Upon the beach I wander still, to gaze out at the sea
Hoping to see her shining face smiling back at me

My star-eyed bride of Alinor
Lost in storm and spray
My star-eyed bride of Alinor
That cruel fate took away
