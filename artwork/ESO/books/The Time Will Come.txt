The Time Will Come

Time spreads out before us, like the branches of a great tree. But the branches narrow, and the leaves that sprout grow ever thinner. I tried to warn the other spinners â€¦ Y'frre grant they heeded my messages, for I knew you would come.

Free me from the bonds he will create, and I will aid you as I can. Kill my spirit and the Silvenar can still prevail, but I will be unable to aid you in the future that grows before you.

The Lovers strive to make wrong right,
The Shadow approaches, threatens endless night.
We rise to our doom in the Tower of the tree,
Our shackles broken, by you, for me.
