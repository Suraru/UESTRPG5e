The Treasure of Stillrise Village

Felra,

Gather your coven and make your way to <<1>> as quickly as possible. A treasure there unlike any we have seen in many generations awaits the Cult of the Black Worm .

Take or create as many animus geodes as possible; you will find use for them, I promise you! I would go myself, but I do not have enough servants in Shadowfen to complete this task to its fullest.

When you arrive, be certain to use your witch-sight on the inhabitants. Not all is as it seems in that quiet little village. You will understand my meaning when you follow my orders.

I would say more, but you know how our communications can be unreliable, even within our ranks. Discover the secret of <<1>> and you'll understand my excitement. Bring back a great treasure, Felra, and you and I will "Still Rise" in the ranks of our Order!
