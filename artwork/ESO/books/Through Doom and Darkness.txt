Through Doom and Darkness

|acThe Chosen Warrior must be fearless even in the face of certain death.
They must not allow darkness into their heart. 

To have no fear of death because one does not value life is easy.
This is the deception of the Dark.

The Chosen Warrior fans the flames that burn in their breast, 
Their heart alight with life and love. 

They fight because they must,
To protect their life and the lives of others.

Know this, or you will not don the mask.
