To Clarice—Be My Darling!

Where'ere I look, my darling Clarice,
I think of you. A flock of geese, 
A lofty cloud, up in the skies,
Reminds me of your brownish eyes.
When in the woods I see a fawn,
I ponder on your hair of tawn.
Across the Iliac I sail
In every wave I never fail
To see you below, also above—
Oh barmaid Clarice, please be my love!

Singed, 

Georges Plouffe, First-Mate (get it?)
