To the Captain

Per your orders, our elite forces are moving up the slope to the Spire.The less seasoned members of the Vanguard will be left behind in Kragenmoor, and in the camp outside of town. 

They need further training if they're to contribute to the grandmaster's plans. Work them hard. 

We know that forces from Virak will be following shortly in the grandmaster's wake. We must be ready to hold the city, and give him the time he needs.

I know we all have reservations about what's happening here. We may have to draw steel on comrades, on our brothers in the alliance. 

We've all seen what the Covenant is capable of. The grandmaster understands, where others do not. They must be stopped, no matter the cost.
