Truths of the North

When the snow fades
and the rivers run fat,
The sun sits like a flower
on a young boy's hat.
The wise Nord knows
it can never last.
He enjoys the day,
though it travels fast.

When the snow is gone,
and rivers run dry,
The sun beats down
like an angry eye.
The wise Nord knows,
though the day is long,
These are the days,
he is hale and strong,
growing like a seed
from the fresh spring soil.

When frost returns
and the rivers choke,
The sun dips in the sky
beneath evening smoke.
The wise Nord knows
though his strength may fade,
It is time to plan,
and time to save.
