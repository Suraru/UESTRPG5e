Uela's Song

By Uela the Ravener

Clouds tower
Beyond peaks
Storm shatters
Mountainside
Wind cudgels	
Canyon wall
Avalanche
Scours gorge
Hunters spear
Cave bears
Tear the flesh
Split the bones
Briarhearts
In the Reach

Bretons hide
From storm wrack
Fear mountains
Shiver, cold
Run to town
Cower, roofed
Go to church
On their knees
Pray to be 
Sheltered, hid
Come out when
Weather's warm
Kill and eat
Helpless lambs

Hunters spear
Soft Bretons
Tear the flesh
Split the bones
