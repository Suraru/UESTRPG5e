Umaril is Undone

Narilmor,

I can confirm it myself: Umaril the Unfeathered died at the Temple of the Ancestors. My own brother carried a piece of the mongrel who dishonored us back home. They left the bastard's head as a gift to the cattle-queen before leaving.

We must forge a unified front against these upstart Men or we might share the same fate as our liege-lord. I trust I'll have your support.
