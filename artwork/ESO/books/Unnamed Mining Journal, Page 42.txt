28 Sisei

Kaoc, spriggans killed Shusaja. I went back to surface and she is dead. My supplies are scattered. Still enough for few days. Still have ore samples. I miss Shusaja, but tonight I make guar stew. 

Today's discovery: lake of magma. Cannot go deeper. Lake of fire bubbles and spits but I do not think it is dangerous. I will prospect one more day. If no good ore, time to move on. Need to make gold.

Supplies
	Fresh guar haunch
	2 dried swamp eel
	9 candles
	1 pots grease
	Fek bag still good
