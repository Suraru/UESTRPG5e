Up High Note

Concerning the baker.

Strange man. Even for a High Elf. Doesn't seem to like many people, and the feeling appears to be mutual. His baking skills are without question, however. In fact, people claim he bakes the best sweetroll in all of the Gold Coast. We really need to check those sweetrolls. I'll place an order.
