Urcelmo's Supplemental Orders

The cemetery southeast of Phaer has long been a problem. We've had reports people have been abducted from the nearby road. Investigate. Eliminate the threat, and do justice to the Dominion.

I look forward to your complete report on this matter.

Battlereeve Urcelmo, Commanding.
