Ushenat's Notes

So far, I am quite pleased with the application of cold as a method for turning people onto the path of Trinimac's holy light. I'm more certain than ever that Graguz and his "initiation" of fire is a terrible approach to recruitment. It has a poor survival rate. Besides, fire panics people, and a panicked person cannot be reasoned with. A true conversion requires us to get into the candidate's mind, show him or her a way out of their fear, and help them come to the proper acceptance of Trinimac's holy grace. 

I think my method is a much more solid approach. (Ha. A pun. Solid. My ice is certainly that!)  Rooting an individual and trapping him or her using the new ice bindings I have crafted provides both pain and security without the unnecessary panic. The added benefit of giving a recruit the option to end the mild (in my opinion) torment is a brilliant idea if I do say so myself. I must remember to send a note to Hengart to thank him for the design of the switches and ice platforms. 

My latest variation in the process seems to be the most effective yet. At the very least, it provides me with a certain level of amusement. I placed two candidates on the ice platforms at the same time and have provided each of them with a switch. And here's the genius of it! Each switch sets the other candidate free! So, which one will decide to sacrifice their own life so that the other may live? And the survivor? His or her guilt will open the path for Trinimac's light. The survivor will accept Trinimac more fully because he or she cannot accept that they caused another to die. The mind and soul will belong to the Vosh Rakh, and Trinimac, utterly and completely.

This dual method is a bit slower, I confess, but I am enjoying watching each candidate's resolve as it starts to crumble. More as the experiment proceeds.
