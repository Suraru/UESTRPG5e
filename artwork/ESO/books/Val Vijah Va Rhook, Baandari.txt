Val Vijah Va Rhook, Baandari

(A Khajiiti Festival Song)

Dancing through savannah grass
On light feet we glide
Hey, hey, Baandari boy
Tap your heels in stride
Hey, hey, Baandari girl
Swing your tail beside

CHORUS
Val Vijah Va Rhook, Baandari
Carrying our world in packs
Val Vijah Va Rhook, Baandari
Our kingdom on our backs

Home is on the move again
On wagon wheels we go
Hey, hey, Baandari boy
Where the wild winds blow
Hey, hey, Baandari girl
Our caravan in tow

CHORUS
Val Vijah Va Rhook, Baandari
Carrying our world in packs
Val Vijah Va Rhook, Baandari
Our kingdom on our backs

Walker we can teach the steps
We'll be your guiding star
Hey, hey, Baandari boy
Keep close and we'll go far
Hey, hey, Baandari girl
Our vagabond bazaar
