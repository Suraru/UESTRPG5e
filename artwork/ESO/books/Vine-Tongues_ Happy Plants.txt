Vine-Tongues: Happy Plants

You have a vine-tongue sapling in a tiny pot, ready to install in your new home. Now what? Simple! Now you do everything in your power to make and keep your little plant happy!

Each vine-tongue is as different as you and I, so some experimentation will be needed to ascertain the best approach to raising your little sapling. In general, you'll need a long rake, a watering can, and a broadswordâ€”they can get a little testy every now and again!

With these three basic tools, you can water your sapling, scratch its back, and make sure to dissuade them when they attempt to devour your neighbor's cat or the local children. Keep these tools on hand for the long and joyful years ahead for you and your vine-tongue!
