Warning to Jardirr

Captain Jardirr,

It's true. The scouts got it right. They're all here, all over. They've got camps on the southern slope of the hill. They've choked off passage between Stony Basin and the Riften valley. 

I managed to get the names of the clan chieftains. 

Rageclaw: Lydi Snowpelt

Boneshaper: Kevinne Blightheart

Stonetalon: Vivian Witchclaw

Ma'am, it's been a pleasure to serve with you.
