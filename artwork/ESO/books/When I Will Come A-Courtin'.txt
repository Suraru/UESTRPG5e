When I Will Come A-Courtin'

When I will come a-courtin'
All to the Shornhelm maids
I'll have a cart all full of silk
And ribbons for their braids.

And wandered he all through the planes
Searching for his bride
But Akatosh has cast him out
In sanction for his pride.

One crown to glory bring
But only blood and death to show them
One crown to glory bring
For Ranser's folly, died.
