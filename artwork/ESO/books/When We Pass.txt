When We Pass

Do not weep for your father, for he goes to join his father. 

Do not weep for your mother, for she goes to join her mother. 

Take only account of yourself, for you will go to join your father and your mother one day as they went to meet theirs.

Treat your children well, for they too will one day come to join you.

Pray for your children's children, for one day they will raise children of their own who will also come to join you.

Walk proudly every day with the firm knowledge in your heart that you will go home. 

You will walk through the Hall of Heroes and find your way to the eternal sands of the Far Shores. 

It has been this way and will be this way for all Ra Gada who walk under the watchful eye of Tu'whacca.
