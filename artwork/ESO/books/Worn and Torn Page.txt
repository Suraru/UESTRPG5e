Worn and Torn Page

My colleague, Aban, had pressed his hands blue against the door. He searched weeks for a hidden compartment, a loose stone; any way in. He had found none. But now I find the way is open.

A year ago, I would have killed to gain entrance to Hel Ra Citadel, for they say no one has stood inside in many lifetimesâ€”that the door was barred and shielded by magical means. A door that hid the secrets of the Ansei and their Shehai.

I go now for the simple honor to do the same as Aban. Visiting such a storied landmark left by our ancestors will stir my soul, I'm sure.
