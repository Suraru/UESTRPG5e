Kassandra,

You asked me and my boys to focus on the area around the Deepmire, and you'll be glad to hear your tip was correct. We've found a sunken city in the swamp. I've never seen anything like it. It must have sunk slowly enough that much of it is still intact. Riddled with traps and curses, of course, but intact.

I'll get to the part you're interested in. The Remnant of Argon, at least as you described it, isn't here as far as I can tell. But one of the Argonians that works for me was able to translate some of the markings in this place. It speaks of a balance that once existed between two tribes. One tribe dedicated themselves to shadow, and the other to the light of the sun. The interplay between these two tribes was said to be the key to the power of old Argonia. The temple we uncovered belonged to the tribe that followed the shadow, though if you ask me there's no evidence that they were anything but crazed lizards practicing ritual sacrifice. The temple of the sun is spoken of as if it is nearby, but there are many doors that remain closed to us here.

Either way, if your treasure exists we might be close to finding it here. I have a feeling we're going to have to figure out how to feed this temple a proper sacrifice to go any further. Fine by me. I'm dying to see how this thing works.
