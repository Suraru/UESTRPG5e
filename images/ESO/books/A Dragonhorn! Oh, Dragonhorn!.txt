A Dragonhorn! Oh, Dragonhorn!

Translated by Adept Izjadi, Star Haven Record Keeper

The Akavir came one day
To our Starry Haven
Warriors proud were they
And not a one unshaven!

They said that Dragons were about
And that we should be wary
"We cannot stay, we cannot fight,
We'll give you what we carry."

A Dragonhorn! Oh, Dragonhorn!
With just one many call
Any Dragon high above
Will have a mighty fall.

A Dragonhorn! Oh, Dragonhorn!
You'll stay in tower high
And if the Dragons do attack
They'll hear your mighty cry!
