A Moment of Your Time?

Our trip to Coldharbour has gone somewhat awry. I do hope this doesn't prove too inconvenient for dear Lady Laurent. She so expects things to go smoothly.

I find myself separated from the others and in the clutches of extremely beautiful Daedra.

The Daedra have been polite so far, if not a little lascivious. Still, I'm not sure that I can fully trust them.

They hold me within a tower. I will continue to write these notes and drop them from my window until I am rescued.
