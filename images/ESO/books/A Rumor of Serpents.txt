A Rumor of Serpents

A Report for the Dragonstar Caravan Company Proctor, Prepared by Scout Zagula

The rumors appear to be correct—at least this time. The old cave complex in the western section of Upper Craglorn known as the Serpent's Nest seems to have attracted its namesake to its sheltered depths. I watched as members of the Scaled Court entered and exited the cave freely, acting like they owned the place or something.

I'm not sure what they're up to in there, but I recommend that we keep our distance. Nothing good can come of inadvertently getting the Dragonstar Caravan Company involved in Scaled Court business.
