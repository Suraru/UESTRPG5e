A Summons of Heroes!

Do you have what it takes to join the most honored fighting company in Skyrim history?

— The Companions are looking for a few good Nord warriors. We want only the bravest and the strongest!

— If you think you have what it takes, report to Fallowstone Hall and ask for Vigrod Wraithbane.

— The application process is dangerous! New recruits have been maimed and even killed. You've been warned!
