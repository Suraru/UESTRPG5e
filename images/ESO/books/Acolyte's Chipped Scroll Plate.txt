Acolyte's Chipped Scroll Plate

Entry 1
While patrolling the Radius with Adjunct Daro, we happened upon a strange sight—someone managed to open a portal into the Clockwork City! Since I had my perception tabulator and Daro at my side, I decided to step closer and investigate.

Entry 2
I decided to take notes, as the perception tabulator can sometimes be temperamental. Without thinking about it, I found myself directly in front of the portal. It has an unusual attraction.

Entry 3
I stepped through the portal, though I can't actually remember doing so. The place is eerily beautiful, like a land of perpetual twilight. That s'wit Daro didn't come with me! No matter. I think I'll look around.
