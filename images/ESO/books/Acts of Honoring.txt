Acts of Honoring

By Nisswo Xeewulm

Through fields you till
Through broken earth
Through crops that you will grow
Honor that which is change

Hear nothing words
Hear many tongues
Hear one truth within it all
Honor that which is void

With bloodied fang
With crushing blow
With your last stuttering breath
Honor that which is death
