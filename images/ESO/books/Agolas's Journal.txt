Agolas's Journal

Entry 297
Caught a new fish. <<1>> has no idea how Orsinium works. Use her to crack the King's Cornerclub?

Entry 298
Put her near the safe, got what's inside, then threw the clueless <<1>>-fish to the Guard. She gets the blame, I get the goods!

Entry 299
All that work for an ugly mug?

Entry 300
No fence will touch this! Need to set up a meet with <<2>> at the Greedy Gut. She'll buy anything. Stashing this north of <<3>> until things settle.
