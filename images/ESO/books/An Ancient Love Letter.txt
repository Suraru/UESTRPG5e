An Ancient Love Letter

My Dearest Aconia,

My heart is chill as the winter's blight
As I stand here in blackest night
You I know can be the only one
To bring me back into the sun.

The waves they crash upon the beach
But it is to you that I beseech
Call me back to your warm embrace
And across time and distance I shall race

The last embers flicker in the flame of war
Let all be as it was once before
Ne'er again shall I sail away
My heart with you will always stay.

Your beloved,

Rogano
