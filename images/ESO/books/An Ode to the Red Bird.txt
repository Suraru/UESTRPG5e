An Ode to the Red Bird

Let us fly together, dear red bird,
set aside the idle talk of stern elders,
as you set aside the ground below!

Grains of sand trickle through the glass:
but when together we fly,
night is one long everlasting journey.

Alight upon my shoulder, my neck, my cheek,
let your sweet beak leave a hundred, 
nay a thousand kisses upon me.

Let us confuse them,
so that no enemy may cast an evil eye,
when it comes to be known the many kisses.
