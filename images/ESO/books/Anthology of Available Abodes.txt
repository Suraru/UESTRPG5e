Anthology of Available Abodes

I have detailed herein the general location and value of most of the homes and rooms for sale in Tamriel. To seek out property without such a guide is a firm misstep. But fear not, for I have done the heavy lifting for you!

For the thrifty, one can purchase a modest inn room. These were recently put on the market, and may serve as a quality starter home:

Mara's Kiss Public House in Vulkhel Guard, Auridon
The Rosy Lion in Daggerfall, Glenumbra
The Ebony Flask Inn Room in Ebonheart, Stonefalls
The Saint Delyn Penthouse in Vivec, Vvardenfell
Golden Gryphon Garret in Alinor, Summerset
Sugar Bowl Suite in Rimmen, Northern Elsweyr
Snowmelt Suite in Solitude, Western Skyrim
Pilgrim's Rest in Leyawiin, Blackwood

If one has more than a few coins to rub together, there are larger apartments available for the vagrant hoping to become a respectable citizen. These include:

Barbed Hook Private Room in Skywatch, Auridon
Sisters of the Sands Apartment in Sentinel, Alik'r Desert
Flaming Nix Deluxe Garret in Mournhold, Deshaan

The following properties are for serious buyers only. Letters of credit will not be accepted for their sale, no matter whose cousin you know:

Kragenhome, Stonefalls
Cyrodilic Jungle House, Malabal Tor
Moonmirth House, Khenarthi's Roost

Nobility and the like will find the following properties the most acceptable, as they usually provide quarters for servants or livestock:

I have seen most of these properties only from afar, as most of their owners are of a private disposition and I wish to respect that. A purchaser would enter a new echelon of society, or become established well outside it if they prefer solitude, in a fortnight:

Serenity Falls Estate, Reaper's March
Daggerfall Overlook, Glenumbra
Ebonheart Chateau, Stonefalls
Hakkvild's High Hall, the Jerall Mountains, east of Craglorn
Hall of the Lunar Champion in Rimmen, Northern Elsweyr
