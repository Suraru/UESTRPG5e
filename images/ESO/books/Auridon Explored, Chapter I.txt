Auridon Explored, Chapter I

Gentle reader, welcome. Welcome to the crystal blue waters and gentle zephyrs of Auridon. Jewel of the Summerset Archipelago and gateway to Tamriel, this fair isle has long been home to the friendliest, the most outward-facing of my noble race.

Herein, I've included an unedited journal of observations. Thoughts jotted down during my most recent trip across the isle. Some of the hidden gems of the isle, some of the most striking locales of this sheltered paradise, will see description in these pages.

From I, your humble guide. Enjoy!
