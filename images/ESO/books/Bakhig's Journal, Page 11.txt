Bakhig's Journal, Page 11

Bakhig's pets danced for him today! 

No. Not a dance, not like those idiot High Elves in their fancy castles. They swarmed up, down, up, down. All over their webs. Like a sweet performance, just for me.

Bakhig's pets want him to know that they are happy he is here. To watch over them.

Bakhig will never let anything happen to his pets.
