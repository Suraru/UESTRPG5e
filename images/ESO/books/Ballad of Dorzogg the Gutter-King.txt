Ballad of Dorzogg the Gutter-King

By Shei-Beekus the Would-Be Bard

He never owned a castle,
Yet he always wore a crown,
And he loved the skeevers and the cutpurses all the same,
He never lorded over but he always lorded true,
With a dozen trusty knights by his side,
They entered the Arena and won against all odds,
And the legend of Dorzogg the Gutter-King spread far and wide.
