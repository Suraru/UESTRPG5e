Big Damn Bugs

The carpenter came today and took a look at the bad beams. I know the Colovians were terrible people. All the bard tales tell us so. Apparently, they were terrible architects, too. The problem wasn't just old wood—but giant termites!

I hate living this close to the eaves of Valenwood. All sorts of creepy things skitter their way into the house in the dark of night. Lo and behold, the very walls contain colonies of these creatures! Damn the bugs! And damn the Colovians!

I wish he hadn't told me. Now I swear I can hear them chewing.
