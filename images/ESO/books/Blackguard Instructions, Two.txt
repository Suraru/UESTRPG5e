Blackguard Instructions, Two

When you unearth the Argonian reliquaries from the specified locations, carefully remove the meditation cylinders and bring them to me at the xanmeer. I can hear your question now: What's a meditation cylinder? Each of the four coffers should contain a stone cylinder covered with Argonian carvings. Do not drop them. Do not break them. Your worthless lives depend on bringing me four intact cylinders.

Don't fail me!
