Blood for Our Enemies

Blood for Our Enemies, Steel for Our Clan

A Traditional Osh Ornim Hymn

The stones speak to us. They grant us strength, they give us power. The stones provide life.

We are the children of the stones. We are the people of the rock. We are the Osh Ornim!

May we listen to the rocks. May we hear the shifting of the stone.

Let the mountains shelter us. Let the land feed us. Let the crows be forever at our backs.

We are the Osh Ornim! Crun granosh! Blood for our enemies! Steel for our clan!
