Bone Orchard Research Log 4

Located a root cluster today. Attempts to immolate, cut, or otherwise destroy it proved fruitless. We will have to find another way.

Consulted with the spinner. She is reluctant to help, but knows to defy me is her death. Still, I do not believe she is aware of our purpose here.

According to her histories, this "Great Tree," as she calls it, is soundly rooted in the skull of one of the wandering ones. When its growth caused it to burst through the skull, a guardian was put in place to ward the roots from harm.

This guardian has slept for many years, and the way to the skull's breach has been buried by ages of undergrowth and decayed foliage.
