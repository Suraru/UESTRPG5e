Book of Excellent Teachings

To open the gate in our mysterious lake,

One must follow the book of teachings.

For only when shapes are set and directions followed,

Will the portal openâ€”but try not to get swallowed.


Let the Sun's spiky rays warm the Northern shore,

As Masser's Full Moon rises in the Western expanse,

And Aetherius' Star sparkles above the Eastern moor,

While the Crescent Moon of Secundus fills the Southern glance.
