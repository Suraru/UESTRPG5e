Brave Little Scrib Song

(A Dark Elf Children's Song)

There's a kwama we all know,
Who's as bold as any Dunmer,
You can see by Torchbug's glow,
Little Scrib, she's such a wonder.

Play, play! Life's an adventure!
Run, run! As fast as you dare!
Sing, sing! Imagine the pleasure!
Everything's fun … when you don't have a care!

Mean Old Torchbug, full of tricks,
His voice crackling like fire,
Advice he shares conflicts,
Sends Little Scrib into trouble dire.

Play, play! Life's an adventure!
Run, run! As fast as you dare!
Sing, sing! Imagine the pleasure!
Everything's fun … when you don't have a care!

Brave Little Scrib with the heart so pure,
Always in search of adventure,
She says "Maybe tomorrow."
He says "If you insist,
But that treasure, you'll miss."

Play, play! Life's an adventure!
Run, run! As fast as you dare!
Sing, sing! Imagine the pleasure!
Everything's fun … when you don't have a care!
