Centurion's Signet

"There are times when all the world turns against the Orsimer. We will fight, we will die, but we will not abandon our honor. We will show the world that we are better than they say. And if we fall, we fall clutching at the throats of our enemies."

These words were spoken by the first Orsimer to earn glory in the service of the Emperor, as recognized by being awarded the rank of Centurion in the Imperial Legion.

The Orc Centurion's name has been lost to the ages, but his signet was seen in the vicinity of Paragon's Remembrance as recently as a decade ago.
