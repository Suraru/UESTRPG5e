Chim-el Adabal: A Ballad

When Akatosh slew Lorkhan,
He ripped his heart right out,
Hurled it across Tamriel,
And the heart was heard to shout:

Red Diamond! Red Diamond!
The heart and soul of Men.
Red Diamond! Red Diamond!
Protect us till the end.

The laughing heart sprayed blood afar,
A gout on Cyrod fell,
And like a dart shot to its mark
Down in an Ayleid Well.

Red Diamond! Red Diamond!
The heart and soul of Men.
Red Diamond! Red Diamond!
Protect us till the end.

Magicka fused the Lorkhan blood
To crystal red and strong
Then Wild Elves cut and polished it down
To Chim-el Adabal.

Red Diamond! Red Diamond!
The heart and soul of Men.
Red Diamond! Red Diamond!
Protect us till the end.

When Elves lost Nirn to Man,
Akatosh gave the stone
To Saint Alesh in token of 
Her right to sit the throne.

Red Diamond! Red Diamond!
The heart and soul of Men.
Red Diamond! Red Diamond!
Protect us till the end.
