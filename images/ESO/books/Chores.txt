Chores

Jenya,

Here's what I want you to do while I'm away. I expect every chore done when I return, or no pudding for you. Get your lazy butt in gear!

1. Sweep the stables.
2. Order horseshoes. (Specify Mathiisen steel this time.)
3. Oil saddles. 
4. Take inventory.
5. Brush stabled mares.
6. Wash down stalls.
