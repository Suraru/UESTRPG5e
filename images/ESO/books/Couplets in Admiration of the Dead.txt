Couplets in Admiration of the Dead

By Ferordomas

There is no living beauty compares
With corpses and their glassy stares

I feel a thrill when I gaze upon
The bodies of the dead and gone

Cadavers cannot refuse your request
Cold and silent, they suit me best

My heart begins to jump and dance
At the very thought of nec-romance
