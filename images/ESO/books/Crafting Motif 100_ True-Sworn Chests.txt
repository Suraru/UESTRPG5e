Crafting Motif 100: True-Sworn Chests

By Cassia Hiriel, Outfitter and Artisan

Ours is a simple task: Pyroturge Encratis requests attire that will allow our agents to infiltrate and destroy their target. As you may expect, the Pyroturge's preferred method for eradicating evidence of True-Sworn presence will consist of burning down the entire villa. To that end, I have designed armor that will protect against the raging inferno that will result. You will also find plans for new weapons among my designs. The item we seek holds great value and we must be the only ones to obtain it. Arming ourselves properly ensures this outcome and advance our timeline.

CHESTS

I chose a darker color scheme for this attire to increase our agents' capability for remaining hidden during the mission. The dark brown leather on the chest is highly flexible, even in the heavier versions. And the deep blue cloth at the joints increase movement. Thick cloth covers the chest and neck area to protect against cinders floating within the air.
