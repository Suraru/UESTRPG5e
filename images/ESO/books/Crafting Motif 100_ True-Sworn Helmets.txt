Crafting Motif 100: True-Sworn Helmets

By Cassia Hiriel, Outfitter and Artisan

Ours is a simple task: Pyroturge Encratis requests attire that will allow our agents to infiltrate and destroy their target. As you may expect, the Pyroturge's preferred method for eradicating evidence of True-Sworn presence will consist of burning down the entire villa. To that end, I have designed armor that will protect against the raging inferno that will result. You will also find plans for new weapons among my designs. The item we seek holds great value and we must be the only ones to obtain it. Arming ourselves properly ensures this outcome and advance our timeline.

HELMETS

I admit to my own cleverness in these designs. The guar leather masks cover the entire face for purposes of anonymity and protection. However, I have added lenses made of amber that filter the bright flames they will encounter. They limit peripheral vision somewhat, but the sacrifice should be worth it.
