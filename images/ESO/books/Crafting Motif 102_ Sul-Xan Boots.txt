Crafting Motif 102: Sul-Xan Boots

By Professor Astinia Bincal, University of Gwylim, Anthropology Department

I feel no need to point out to my readers that scholars of Argonian cultural mores come by the bushel. The recent mania in our scholarly community to expose "dark secrets" of the beast race in the swamps has led to such trite revelations as "On Crunchy Bugs and Moist Spines- An Investigation into Gustatory Practices of Southern Argonians." However, during a recent sojourn through Blackwood, I encountered a tribe with a culture so distinct that I felt compelled to document it. After my entourage graciously cut down several of these Sul-Xan, I collected their effects. What follows are descriptions of the materials and methods of construction which appear unique to this group.

BOOTS
I regret that my time trudging through the swamps left mud caked within my every pore. So, when I see the Sul-Xan footwear has an open-toed design, I admit my bafflement. Perhaps the claws of the tribe are especially sharp? The supple leather structure does offer impressive support on the calf area. I imagine they find it helpful while chasing down prey as it flees at high speed.
