Crafting Motif 102: Sul-Xan Gloves

By Professor Astinia Bincal, University of Gwylim, Anthropology Department

I feel no need to point out to my readers that scholars of Argonian cultural mores come by the bushel. The recent mania in our scholarly community to expose "dark secrets" of the beast race in the swamps has led to such trite revelations as "On Crunchy Bugs and Moist Spines- An Investigation into Gustatory Practices of Southern Argonians." However, during a recent sojourn through Blackwood, I encountered a tribe with a culture so distinct that I felt compelled to document it. After my entourage graciously cut down several of these Sul-Xan, I collected their effects. What follows are descriptions of the materials and methods of construction which appear unique to this group.

GLOVES
Much like the boots, Sul-Xan gloves are opened to bare the claws. Argonian fighters always have one last line of defense should they lose a weapon. Along the top of the wrist and forearm, they have placed a thick metal brace to prevent the loss of the combatant's sharp claws.
