Crafting Motif 102: Sul-Xan Maces

By Professor Astinia Bincal, University of Gwylim, Anthropology Department

I feel no need to point out to my readers that scholars of Argonian cultural mores come by the bushel. The recent mania in our scholarly community to expose "dark secrets" of the beast race in the swamps has led to such trite revelations as "On Crunchy Bugs and Moist Spines- An Investigation into Gustatory Practices of Southern Argonians." However, during a recent sojourn through Blackwood, I encountered a tribe with a culture so distinct that I felt compelled to document it. After my entourage graciously cut down several of these Sul-Xan, I collected their effects. What follows are descriptions of the materials and methods of construction which appear unique to this group.

MACES
The Sul-Xan imagination for their maces does not seem to have gone much further than "heavy and hard." The heads are a fat cylinder of dense metal, perhaps steel, with decorative designs etched in. The handles are simple but display the same jade circle on the end that we see on the other weapons.
