Crafting Motif 102: Sul-Xan Shields

By Professor Astinia Bincal, University of Gwylim, Anthropology Department

I feel no need to point out to my readers that scholars of Argonian cultural mores come by the bushel. The recent mania in our scholarly community to expose "dark secrets" of the beast race in the swamps has led to such trite revelations as "On Crunchy Bugs and Moist Spines- An Investigation into Gustatory Practices of Southern Argonians." However, during a recent sojourn through Blackwood, I encountered a tribe with a culture so distinct that I felt compelled to document it. After my entourage graciously cut down several of these Sul-Xan, I collected their effects. What follows are descriptions of the materials and methods of construction which appear unique to this group.

SHIELDS
Of all Sul-Xan armaments, I appreciate their shields the most. Unlike the ovoid appearance of many other cultures, these are more angular. Notches on each side offer resting places for weapons to stab without dropping protection. And impressive jade work upon the surface demonstrates a greater eye for artistry than expected from these savages.
