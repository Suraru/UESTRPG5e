Crafting Motif 103: Black Fin Legion Staves

By Keshu the Black Fin

Many outsiders assume the Black Fin Legion is an army of Argonians whose purpose is to protect Argonians. They are mistaken. We serve all people who wish to live in peace, Man or Saxhleel. It is my belief that we can best defend our new home in Gideon by standing shoulder-to-shoulder with our neighbors, not by fighting to protect only our own. People of all races are welcome in the Black Fin Legion—a stout arm and a willing heart are all I ask.

The first enemy that an army in the borderlands of the Black Marsh must face is the climate itself. Here, iron and steel rust without special oils, bowstrings rot, and weapon hafts made from northern woods begin to warp. From head to toe, the Black Fin legionnaire must dress for conditions that destroy the arms and armor of other lands. But if the swamp is an enemy to the unprepared, it can also be a potent ally for the warrior who learns its ways.

Green, of course, must be the primary color of the Black Fin Legion. In the forests and swamps surrounding Gideon, the value of camouflage cannot be overlooked. Highlights of brass and gold may seem out of place, but they too have a purpose. They mimic the glint of sunlight on water.

STAVES
The dense ground cover and frequent downpours of the Black Marsh ensure that many skirmishes take place at very short range. Every Black Fin legionnaire—archer, footsoldier, or spellcaster—must be ready for close combat. For that reason, Black Fin Legion staves feature lead striking heads and sturdy brass hafts for those times when spellcasters find themselves in melee.
