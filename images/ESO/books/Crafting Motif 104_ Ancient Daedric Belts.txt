Crafting Motif 104: Ancient Daedric Belts

By Tirdos Renam, Smith of the Arcane

Mad! Mad, they call me! These flat-headed smiths with their smoldering forges no larger than tea kettles. Should we not heed the challenge of Boethiah? Should we cower in the face of the Testing Gods? These sour-hearted cowards may be content to hammer out nails and nixshoes, but not I. I look to grander things. Distant realms! Mighty tools! Designs that exceed mortal handiwork in every conceivable respect! Compared to Daedric craft, even the keenest Nirn-blade is no sharper than a butter knife. The sturdiest Dunmeri shield affords less protection than a sheet of Daedric parchment. I will pry these secrets from the blazing corner of the House of Troubles by sweat and blood.

This journal shall serve as a fulsome account of what I find wandering the Destroyer-God's realm. With these designs committed to the page, I shall return to Morrowind not as a simple smith, but as a master of the Daedric forge!

BELTS
I acquired a Daedric belt and even now, weeks on, I cannot identify the source of the leather. Many hulking beasts wander the Deadlands. Any one of them could have supplied the hide. If I were forced to compare it to something on Nirn, I'd compare it to an elder alitâ€”one scarred and battered by years in the ash. The buckle features sharp edges and spikes, making cinching a dangerous task. But once secured, nothing short of a Daedroth's bite could break this belt's hold.
