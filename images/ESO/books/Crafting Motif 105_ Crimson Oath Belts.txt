Crafting Motif 105: Crimson Oath Belts

By Disastrix Zkizskz

We are the oathsworn of the Red Father. The scarlet reavers of the Razor King. The bloodletters of the Fire-Veined God. We are the Crimson Oath! We offer endless death and destruction to Lord Dagon be it our enemy's or our own. When we take the field of battle, we vow one thing: blood will spill. Take your oath garb and drench it in the gore of our enemies. This is the greatest offering you can make to our Great Prince.

BELTS
A gut wound is your worst enemy. It offers you nothing but a lingering death, uselessly languishing on the battlefield instead of dying in a glorious display. For this reason, we wear the rigid girdles around our abdomens. Trade your arm, leg, or even your neck to protect it, or you'll suffer a wretched end beneath the gaze of our Lord.
