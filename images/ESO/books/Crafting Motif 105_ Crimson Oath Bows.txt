Crafting Motif 105: Crimson Oath Bows

By Disastrix Zkizskz

We are the oathsworn of the Red Father. The scarlet reavers of the Razor King. The bloodletters of the Fire-Veined God. We are the Crimson Oath! We offer endless death and destruction to Lord Dagon be it our enemy's or our own. When we take the field of battle, we vow one thing: blood will spill. Take your oath garb and drench it in the gore of our enemies. This is the greatest offering you can make to our Great Prince.

BOWS
The barbs of arrows are best used to hinder a foe, not slay them. There is no enjoyment to be had in quick strike to the head or the heart. Leave your enemy hobbling and you will know the joys of beating your foes with the springy snap of a spike covered bow. It is a slow and satisfying process.
