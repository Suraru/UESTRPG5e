Crafting Motif 105: Crimson Oath Chests

By Disastrix Zkizskz

We are the oathsworn of the Red Father. The scarlet reavers of the Razor King. The bloodletters of the Fire-Veined God. We are the Crimson Oath! We offer endless death and destruction to Lord Dagon be it our enemy's or our own. When we take the field of battle, we vow one thing: blood will spill. Take your oath garb and drench it in the gore of our enemies. This is the greatest offering you can make to our Great Prince.

CHEST PIECES
Leave your chests bare and show your scars, or wrap them in the many bloodied bandages of battles prior. Let the enemy see how long it has been since you have tasted failure and death. Mourn the loss of them when next the Deadlands spits you out naked and fresh.
