Crafting Motif 105: Crimson Oath Daggers

By Disastrix Zkizskz

We are the oathsworn of the Red Father. The scarlet reavers of the Razor King. The bloodletters of the Fire-Veined God. We are the Crimson Oath! We offer endless death and destruction to Lord Dagon be it our enemy's or our own. When we take the field of battle, we vow one thing: blood will spill. Take your oath garb and drench it in the gore of our enemies. This is the greatest offering you can make to our Great Prince.

DAGGERS
Jagged and hooked! Razored and sawed! This is a tool of pain! It must be made to cut and rend and tear! I find them more fitting for entertainment after a battle, but I will admit some of you can make a delightful display of toying with your prey.
