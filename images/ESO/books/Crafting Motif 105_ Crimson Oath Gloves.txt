Crafting Motif 105: Crimson Oath Gloves

By Disastrix Zkizskz

We are the oathsworn of the Red Father. The scarlet reavers of the Razor King. The bloodletters of the Fire-Veined God. We are the Crimson Oath! We offer endless death and destruction to Lord Dagon be it our enemy's or our own. When we take the field of battle, we vow one thing: blood will spill. Take your oath garb and drench it in the gore of our enemies. This is the greatest offering you can make to our Great Prince.

GLOVES
Protect your hands as dearly as your guts. What use will you be unable to carry a weapon or strangle life out of a foe? Heavy hides, iron, and good sharp spines will ensure your fists carry on dishing out pain for eons to come.
