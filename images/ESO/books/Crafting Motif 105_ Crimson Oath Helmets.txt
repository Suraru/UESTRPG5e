Crafting Motif 105: Crimson Oath Helmets

By Disastrix Zkizskz

We are the oathsworn of the Red Father. The scarlet reavers of the Razor King. The bloodletters of the Fire-Veined God. We are the Crimson Oath! We offer endless death and destruction to Lord Dagon be it our enemy's or our own. When we take the field of battle, we vow one thing: blood will spill. Take your oath garb and drench it in the gore of our enemies. This is the greatest offering you can make to our Great Prince.

HELMETS
A secret I'll share: the mortals are unsettled by an unclear face and patterns of holes. Something in their weak, little minds quavers at the sight of them. Replace your face with such sights and you'll taste a rare treat in the nectar of their fear.
