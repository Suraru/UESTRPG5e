Crafting Motif 105: Crimson Oath Shields

By Disastrix Zkizskz

We are the oathsworn of the Red Father. The scarlet reavers of the Razor King. The bloodletters of the Fire-Veined God. We are the Crimson Oath! We offer endless death and destruction to Lord Dagon be it our enemy's or our own. When we take the field of battle, we vow one thing: blood will spill. Take your oath garb and drench it in the gore of our enemies. This is the greatest offering you can make to our Great Prince.

SHIELDS
Shields may seem like a waste, but if made well—and used skillfully—even these tools for protection can bring pain and destruction to your enemies. Find the sturdiest plates, rivet them together, add as many spikes as you fancy and ram your enemy with it in a headlong charge. You'll see.
