Crafting Motif 105: Crimson Oath Swords

By Disastrix Zkizskz

We are the oathsworn of the Red Father. The scarlet reavers of the Razor King. The bloodletters of the Fire-Veined God. We are the Crimson Oath! We offer endless death and destruction to Lord Dagon be it our enemy's or our own. When we take the field of battle, we vow one thing: blood will spill. Take your oath garb and drench it in the gore of our enemies. This is the greatest offering you can make to our Great Prince.

SWORDS
The Crimson Oath has no need for what the loathsome mortals call "swordplay." Just writing it makes me retch. A sword is not a plaything. It requires no artistry. It needs to cut and cut well. Hone a hunk of forge-smudged iron to an edge you can put all your might behind. That is all you need.
