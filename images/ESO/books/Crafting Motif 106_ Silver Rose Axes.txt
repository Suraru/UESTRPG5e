Crafting Motif 106: Silver Rose Axes

By Chief Archivist Bartholomew

AXES

These curvaceous axes are not the decorative pieces that their gilt and filigreed beards might lead you to believe. Beneath their brilliant veneer lies a skeleton of Daggerfall steel capable of sundering the armor of a mortal foe as surely as the pure silver on their surface can cleave the spawn of Oblivion.
