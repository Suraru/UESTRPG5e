Crafting Motif 106: Silver Rose Bows

By Chief Archivist Bartholomew

Like our namesake, the liveries of the venerable Knights of the Silver Rose have grown haler and more beautiful with each generation, tended by collective wisdom and guidance of our order.

BOWS

Our bowyers almost exclusively work in Wrothgarian mahogany. Their techniques for shaping this notoriously rigid wood are so refined and subtle that they would appear—to the untrained eye—like a potter shaping clay. Hewing and sanding carefully along the natural grain coaxes an impressive springiness to the normally inflexible wood.
