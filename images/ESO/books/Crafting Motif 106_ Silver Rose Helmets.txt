Crafting Motif 106: Silver Rose Helmets

By Chief Archivist Bartholomew

Like our namesake, the liveries of the venerable Knights of the Silver Rose have grown haler and more beautiful with each generation, tended by collective wisdom and guidance of our order. Here I record the essential elements of form and function in our arms and armaments as dictated by Prior Theirric Sarazen, Knight-Commander of the Silver Rose, 2E 579.

HELMETS

Most of our infantry and cavalry favor the elegance of a visored sallet, to provide exceptional protection while allowing for greater visibility and comfort when needed. This greatly contrasts near complete encapsulation of the head by our heavy barbutes and, unlike many other such helms, ours possess three reinforced arches along the skull capable of withstanding a two-handed hammer blow.
