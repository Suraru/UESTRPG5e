Crafting Motif 106: Silver Rose Shoulders

By Chief Archivist Bartholomew

Like our namesake, the liveries of the venerable Knights of the Silver Rose have grown haler and more beautiful with each generation, tended by collective wisdom and guidance of our order. Here I record the essential elements of form and function in our arms and armaments as dictated by Prior Theirric Sarazen, Knight-Commander of the Silver Rose, 2E 579.

SHOULDERS

Secure shoulder armor is important for even our most lightly armored combatants when it comes to rear-line regimented combat and garrison defense. From these positions our knights can present their most well defended front to the enemy without encumbering them needlessly. The tradeoff in protection is more than made up for by the mobility granted to react to flanking maneuvers.
