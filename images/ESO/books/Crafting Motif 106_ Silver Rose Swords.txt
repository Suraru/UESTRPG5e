Crafting Motif 106: Silver Rose Swords

By Chief Archivist Bartholomew

Like our namesake, the liveries of the venerable Knights of the Silver Rose have grown haler and more beautiful with each generation, tended by collective wisdom and guidance of our order. Here I record the essential elements of form and function in our arms and armaments as dictated by Prior Theirric Sarazen, Knight-Commander of the Silver Rose, 2E 579.

SWORDS

Swords of the Silver Rose must be constructed more sturdily than those seen among other knightly orders. Full tang, tapered blades are mounted into heavily reinforced cross guards to prevent the entire blade from being snapped off in clashes with monstrous foes like Ogrims and Daedroths. Even a broken blade is better than none.
