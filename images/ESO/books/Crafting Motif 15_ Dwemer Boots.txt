Crafting Motif 15: Dwemer Boots

By Raynor Vanos

Kireth says I should write down what I've learned about Dwemer artisans and the styles and motifs of their lost civilization. 

BOOTS

Dwarven boots are sturdy, but not as heavy as they look. Though they have accents of Dwarven metal, they are mainly constructed of a flexible material that resembles leather, but either it is some sort of manufactured imitation, or the Dwemer had beasts with incredibly smooth and homogenous hide. Knee-high Dwarven boots often incorporate built-in greaves over the shins.
