Crafting Motif 16: Glass Chests

By Vandalion Brightsteel, Armorsmith Peerless of Vulkhel Guard

CHESTS

The downward-pointing chevrons on Glass cuirasses evoke the deep-muscled chests of great flying creatures, and indeed the chest plates are often adorned with images of eagles, Dragons, or cliff racers. They are constructed of leather, steel, and glass, with as much additional glass trim as the buyer can afford.
