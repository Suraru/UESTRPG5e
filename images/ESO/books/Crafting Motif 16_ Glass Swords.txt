SWORDS

A Glass sword is a cunning combination of steel core and tang with a glass point and edges. The blade may be quite broad near the tip, and even "feathered" with shallow blood gutters. Despite their size, the blades are light, favored by sword-fighters for their ease of use and battlefield durabilityâ€”for a glass sword will hold its edge long after a steel or alloy sword has gone dull.
