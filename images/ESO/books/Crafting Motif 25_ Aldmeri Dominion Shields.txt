Crafting Motif 25: Aldmeri Dominion Shields

Aldmeri Dominion Arms and Armor

By Aicantar of Shimmerene, Sapiarch of Indoctrination

Attention smiths, forgers, weapon-masters, and arms crafters: the following are the specifications for all work to be done for the Aldmeri Dominion military. We expect the finest workmanship in every piece, for those of Aldmeri heritage can do no less, but deviation from these norms is not acceptable. I have heard some commentary to the effect that the Aldmeri Eagle is overused in these designs. Such remarks are contrary to Praxis. 

Do it right. Do it well. Do it to honor the Ancestors.
 
SHIELDS

The shining shield of the Dominion is worked with an intricate design that combines both the eagle of Summerset and the graht-tree of Valenwood, thus commemorating the historic alliance between our two Elven races!
