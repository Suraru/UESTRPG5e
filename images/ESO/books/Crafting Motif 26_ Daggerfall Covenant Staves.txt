Crafting Motif 26: Daggerfall Covenant Staves

Daggerfall Covenant Arms and Armor

By General Baryctor Stelanie

Yes, we based the Daggerfall Covenant arms and armor on classic Second Empire designs, and we're unapologetic about it. In fact, we're proud! The Covenant represents the continuing ideals of Reman's Imperium, the uncontested height of Tamrielic civilization, when everyone, even the Orcs, were included in history's greatest confederation. Insofar as we seek to restore those lost glories, we deliberately hark back to them in our designs and symbolism.

STAVES

When it comes to magic, it's the Bretons who are the most naturally talented of the Covenant allies, and the High Rock spellcasters are proud to wield staves tipped with the lion rampant of Emeric, our High King. The wrought-metal lion typically rears atop a facet-cut focusing crystal of some sort.
