Crafting Motif 35: Dro-m'Athra Gloves

By Twilight Cantor Adara'hai

Somewhere, deep in the Dark Behind the World, there are grim forges and bent benches where Lost Cats arm and armor themselves. On those dire times when they appear among us, their outfitting is much alike, implying they are made to certain standards. This one shall sing the song of these standards below. Because all knowledge is useful, no? If only to know what to stay away from. 

GLOVES

Gauntlets protect hands from blows, of course, but also it is cold, very cold in Dark Behind the World, so wear gloves. Fingertips are coveredâ€”where are Khajiiti claws? On forearm, blue claw marks, but on hands, no claws. Very disturbing.
