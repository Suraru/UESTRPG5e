Crafting Motif 38: Draugr Bows

By Narsis Dren—Treasure Hunter

So, you want to be able to pass yourself off as a Draugr? That makes perfect sense! Done it myself, and more than once! Just follow my instructions below, and you'll have gear so Draugr-y not even a Dragon Priest's mother could tell it from the real thing! After all, if you're going to imitate my exploits recovering relics from ancient Nord tombs, in theory it will go much easier if it looks like you belong there! 

Anyway, that's the theory. 

BOWS

How Draugr bows maintain their flexibility and functionality after rotting in a vault for a thousand years is a mystery, even to me—but they work just fine, and I've got the arrow-scars to prove it. However, if you don't want your "new" Draugr bow to snap in half when you draw it, I advise using fresh materials. Just antique it appropriately for that musty from-the-catacombs look.
