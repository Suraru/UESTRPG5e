Crafting Motif 42: Hollowjack Axes

By the Hollowjack Cantor

Conjure, conjure, jill and jack
Harvest arms and armor tack
Pumpkin drear and black hawthorn
Wrought into grim garments worn

AXES

Cur-ved blade and wicked point 
Victim disembowel and joint
Chop and amputate and hack
Happy work for Hollowjack
