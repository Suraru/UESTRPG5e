Crafting Motif 42: Hollowjack Chests

By the Hollowjack Cantor

Conjure, conjure, jill and jack
Harvest arms and armor tack
Pumpkin drear and black hawthorn
Wrought into grim garments worn

CHESTS

Cuirass of enduring rind
Guarding torso fore and hind
Turn all weapons, point and edge
Like impenetrable hedge
