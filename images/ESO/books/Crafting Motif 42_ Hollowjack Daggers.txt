Crafting Motif 42: Hollowjack Daggers

By the Hollowjack Cantor

Conjure, conjure, jill and jack
Harvest arms and armor tack
Pumpkin drear and black hawthorn
Wrought into grim garments worn

DAGGERS

Bodkin blade dig inward deep
Tween yon ribs and organs creep
Like vine of orange jack-all fruit
A pumpkin knife of ill repute
