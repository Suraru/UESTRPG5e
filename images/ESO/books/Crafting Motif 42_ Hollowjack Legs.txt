Crafting Motif 42: Hollowjack Legs

By the Hollowjack Cantor

Conjure, conjure, jill and jack
Harvest arms and armor tack
Pumpkin drear and black hawthorn
Wrought into grim garments worn

LEG GREAVES

Rind and bark are intersected
Lower limbs shall be protected
Weapons swung and darts projected
Shall be tur-ned or deflected
