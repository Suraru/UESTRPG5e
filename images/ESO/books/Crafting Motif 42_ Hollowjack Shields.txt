Crafting Motif 42: Hollowjack Shields

By the Hollowjack Cantor

Conjure, conjure, jill and jack
Harvest arms and armor tack
Pumpkin drear and black hawthorn
Wrought into grim garments worn

SHIELDS

Hawthorn bark and twisted limb
Ward with visage gaunt and grim
Despite what weapon foe will wield
None shall penetrate this shield
