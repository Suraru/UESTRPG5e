Crafting Motif 42: Hollowjack Shoulders

By the Hollowjack Cantor

Conjure, conjure, jill and jack
Harvest arms and armor tack
Pumpkin drear and black hawthorn
Wrought into grim garments worn

SHOULDERS

Summon pauldrons, shoulder plate
Deadly damage shall abate
Rind be tough and vine be long
Hollowjack be armor strong
