Crafting Motif 42: Hollowjack Style

By the Hollowjack Cantor

Conjure, conjure, jill and jack
Harvest arms and armor tack
Pumpkin drear and black hawthorn
Wrought into grim garments worn

AXES

Cur-ved blade and wicked point 
Victim disembowel and joint
Chop and amputate and hack
Happy work for Hollowjack

BELTS

Cincture hold our raiment tight
Sure and secure to prowl the night
Straps to hold our weapons near
Ready all for time of fear

BOOTS

Soles of rind and pointed toes
Shall surprise unwary foes
Hollowjack shall ever tread
On the corpses of the dead

BOWS

Thorn-tree wood, bend and release
Thor-ned arrow, mark decease
Flet-ched dart, twist and fly
Taking target through the eye

CHESTS

Cuirass of enduring rind
Guarding torso fore and hind
Turn all weapons, point and edge
Like impenetrable hedge

DAGGERS

Bodkin blade dig inward deep
Tween yon ribs and organs creep
Like vine of orange jack-all fruit
A pumpkin knife of ill repute

GLOVES

Thor-ned night-black gauntlets planned 
To cover Hollowjacky hand
But flexible so hands can strangle
Throttle, eye-gouge, tear, and mangle

HELMETS

Grinning Hollowjack must laugh
Dismember, threshing, wheat from chaff
Now inner anger embers show
As lambent eye-slits ever glow

LEG GREAVES

Rind and bark are intersected
Lower limbs shall be protected
Weapons swung and darts projected
Shall be tur-ned or deflected


MACES

Pointed hammer made to puncture
Mail and armor at their juncture
Hollowjack fair grins with glee
Murd'ring on a killing spree

SHIELDS

Hawthorn bark and twisted limb
Ward with visage gaunt and grim
Despite what weapon foe will wield
None shall penetrate this shield

SHOULDERS

Summon pauldrons, shoulder plate
Deadly damage shall abate
Rind be tough and vine be long
Hollowjack be armor strong

STAVES

Summon segments, mirthful medley
Hollowjack staff long and deadly
Casting spells good and malign
Pumpkin daemon knows the sign

SWORDS

Sword to cut, a blade to sever
Crafting a condign endeavor
Point to pommel, edge to back
Scimitar for Hollowjack
