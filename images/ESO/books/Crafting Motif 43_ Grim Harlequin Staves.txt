Crafting Motif 43: Grim Harlequin Staves

GRIM HARLEQUIN STYLE
By Chamberlain Haskill

My Lord Sheogorath has directed me to compile a guide for those seeking to create "Grim Harlequin" arms and armor, so that the Mad God's mortal servants may have a way to make all their equipment look the same. Of course, this standardization runs counter to all other cult practices, and is insane on the face of it. (Ahem.) Milord has probably already forgotten he asked me to do it, but what better do I have to do with my time than write manuals for mortals? 

Actually, almost anything, now that I think about it. 

STAVES

I already effused about the fool's-capped grinning skull on the mace head; doing so again about the same motif on the finial of the Grim Harlequin staff would be just rather tedious. I would prefer not to.
