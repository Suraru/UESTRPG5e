Crafting Motif 47: Buoyant Armiger Axes

BUOYANT ARMIGER STYLE

By Lord Vivec

Vivec smiled at those brave souls around him and summoned celebration demons to cleave unto the victors. There was a great display of love and duty around the netted monster, and Vivec was at the center with a headdress made of mating bones. He laughed and told mystical jokes and made the heads of the three houses marry and become a new order. "You shall forever be now my Buoyant Armigers," he said.

AXES

"So to quiet his mind the Hortator chose from the Fight Racks an axe. He named it and moved on to the first moon." And the edge of the blade of the axe of the Armiger shall be rippled like a hanging curtain, a tapestry for cutting.
