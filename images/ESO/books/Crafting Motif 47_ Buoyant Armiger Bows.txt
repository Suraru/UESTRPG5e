Crafting Motif 47: Buoyant Armiger Bows

BUOYANT ARMIGER STYLE

By Lord Vivec

Vivec smiled at those brave souls around him and summoned celebration demons to cleave unto the victors. There was a great display of love and duty around the netted monster, and Vivec was at the center with a headdress made of mating bones. He laughed and told mystical jokes and made the heads of the three houses marry and become a new order. "You shall forever be now my Buoyant Armigers," he said.

BOWS

"Out of their fortresses they came with golden ballistae that walked and mighty atronachs and things that spat flame and things that made killing songs." To afflict enemies from afar with singing darts, the Armiger must have a bow of chitin and verdigris, doubly recurved.
