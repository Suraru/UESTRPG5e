Crafting Motif 47: Buoyant Armiger Helmets

BUOYANT ARMIGER STYLE

By Lord Vivec

Vivec smiled at those brave souls around him and summoned celebration demons to cleave unto the victors. There was a great display of love and duty around the netted monster, and Vivec was at the center with a headdress made of mating bones. He laughed and told mystical jokes and made the heads of the three houses marry and become a new order. "You shall forever be now my Buoyant Armigers," he said.

HELMETS

"CHEMUA, the Running Hunger, who appeared as a mounted soldier with full helm, had the powers of Heart Roaring and of sky sickening." And who shall be crowned like the Buoyant Armiger, with verdant flares of solid flame?
