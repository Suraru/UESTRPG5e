Crafting Motif 51: Hlaalu Belts

By Mastercraft Mediator Rolis Hlaalu

Trade makes the world go 'round, and in trade, reputation is everything, so maintaining House Hlaalu's reputation for reliability is critical to our continued pre-eminence in mercantile affairs. The arms and armor of our House guards and marines must adhere to strict standards in quality and appearance, exemplifying that dependability expected from us by our trading partners. Where possible, we adorn our items with the stylized merchant-scale sigil that symbolizes the source of our power. 

BELTS

Our belts are made of double-tanned guar hide, strong and thick, to support tassets, weapons, and of course money pouches. The buckle in front may display a Hlaalu House symbol or a personal family crest.
