Crafting Motif 52: Redoran Staves

By Vindamea Redoran, House Procurement Sister, Vivec City

Should any non-Redoran ask you why our arms and armor are inspired by the claws and chitin of gigantic arthropods, just ask them if they've seen any Emperor Crabs latelyâ€”you know, those cathedral-sized crustaceans that once roamed the ashlands of Vvardenfell. Where did those go? 

We killed them. We, the warriors of House Redoran. 

Duty, gravity, and piety: these are our watchwords. We are the wartime defenders of the House Dunmer of Morrowind. Follow the guidelines graven below for crafting in the Redoran style, and do not cut corners, for that would be unworthy of our House. 

STAVES

The finial of a Redoran mage's spell staff echoes the shalk-mandible horns of our helmets. To keep these twin prongs from getting entangled with enemy armor in close combat, they are designed to easily break away without damage, and fit back onto the staff's shaft when the battle is over.
