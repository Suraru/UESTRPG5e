Crafting Motif 54: Bloodforge Boots

By Stoneheart the Heartstone

Clanfellows, in the name of the Hunt-Father, whom I invoke in his aspect as Alrabeg the Hunter, take now to heart these sacred schema that define the trappings of we who work the Bloodroot Forge. For it is as Bloodforge Smiths that we shall hammer the Nords upon the anvil of our rage and hatred, until all bend the knee before the Hunters of Hircine. Fellihboh! 

BOOTS

Leather and stud, foot defense, kick and stomp, on offense, chase the prey, forward hence.
