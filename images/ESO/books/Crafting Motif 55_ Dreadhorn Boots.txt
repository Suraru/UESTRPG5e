Crafting Motif 55: Dreadhorn Boots

By Gherig Bullblood of the Dreadhorn Clan [Notes by Rena Hammerhands]

Wayward sons and daughters, set aside your old ways and embrace the Hunt-Father's terrible champion Domihaus! Henceforth, his ways shall be our ways! Listen to these, the new precepts for crafting our arms and armor, and set to work to outfit our reborn clanâ€”as the Dreadhorn! 

[Found this in the Forge, instructions for scum on how to make scum-work. Who knew those barbarians could read, let alone write?]

BOOTS

Though our feet have been hardened by the pitiless stone of the Jerall Mountains, we will clad them in the unshorn skins of the bulls to keep our blood running hot and ready to stampede alongside the chosen.

[Until they trip over all the loose straps.]
