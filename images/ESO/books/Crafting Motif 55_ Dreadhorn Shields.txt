Crafting Motif 55: Dreadhorn Shields

By Gherig Bullblood of the Dreadhorn Clan [Notes by Rena Hammerhands]

Wayward sons and daughters, set aside your old ways and embrace the Hunt-Father's terrible champion Domihaus! Henceforth, his ways shall be our ways! Listen to these, the new precepts for crafting our arms and armor, and set to work to outfit our reborn clanâ€”as the Dreadhorn!

SHIELDS

Just as the bulls lower their heads for the charge, so too will we raise shields forged in their likeness and take their power as our own. Brand its face in brass and mark it with the glyphs of the Horned Lord's chosen.

[A solid chunk of crude steel can block a fine blade, but that won't matter once they're too tired to bring it to bear.]
