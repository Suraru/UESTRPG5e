Crafting Motif 55: Dreadhorn Shoulders

By Gherig Bullblood of the Dreadhorn Clan [Notes by Rena Hammerhands]

Wayward sons and daughters, set aside your old ways and embrace the Hunt-Father's terrible champion Domihaus! Henceforth, his ways shall be our ways! Listen to these, the new precepts for crafting our arms and armor, and set to work to outfit our reborn clanâ€”as the Dreadhorn! 

[Found this in the Forge, instructions for scum on how to make scum-work. Who knew those barbarians could read, let alone write?]

SHOULDERS

Combined with our helms, our pauldrons help shape us into the visage of the broad shouldered beasts we march alongside. Craft them of leather or steel, but do not neglect to present the haired hide as your mantle.

[If these savages worshiped wolves he'd be telling them to walk on all fours too.]
