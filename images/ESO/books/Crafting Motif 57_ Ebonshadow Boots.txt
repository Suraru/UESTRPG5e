Crafting Motif 57: Ebonshadow Boots

By Romien Garvette of the Whispering Shadows

You want to be beautiful. Beautiful, and whispering. Whispering, and dark. Dark, and beautiful, and whisperingâ€”with claws, such claws. You shall be cold, and sharp, and dark. You will be Ebonshadow.  

You cannot rest, you can never rest, so you might as well craft. Craft arms for Her will; craft armor for Her machinations. You are filled with dark nothingness, filled until you spill it into that which you shall make. And for that time of making, though you do it alone, that time alone will have Meaning. 

BOOTS

You're already sinking into the shadows, up past your feet, up your legs. But it will not devour you, no. You've shaped the darkness. You've shaped, and strapped, and it has become a part of you. Boots which allow you to walk between the shadows, between the worlds.
