Crafting Motif 57: Ebonshadow Swords

By Romien Garvette of the Whispering Shadows

You want to be beautiful. Beautiful, and whispering. Whispering, and dark. Dark, and beautiful, and whisperingâ€”with claws, such claws. You shall be cold, and sharp, and dark. You will be Ebonshadow.  

You cannot rest, you can never rest, so you might as well craft. Craft arms for Her will; craft armor for Her machinations. You are filled with dark nothingness, filled until you spill it into that which you shall make. And for that time of making, though you do it alone, that time alone will have Meaning. 

SWORDS

A blade of black, elegant, deadly. Like Her words which filled your ears one night. The edge is sharp, unforgiving. It's hungry, don't you hear it? It calls for warmth. For blood. Those who dare defy Her shall feed it. Hungry, like her crows are hungry, like you're always hungry. For warmth. For death.
