Crafting Motif 60: Worm Cult Axes

By the Worm of Songs

In death is life, reanimation
A sacred and a dark vocation
Our Order's garb all shall recall
Their final sight before they fall 

AXES

Worm axe blade's like a severed ear
Restored to life as metal hacker
A mighty arm that all must fear
Glint of steel and gleam of lacquer
