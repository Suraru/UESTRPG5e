Crafting Motif 60: Worm Cult Belts

By the Worm of Songs

In death is life, reanimation
A sacred and a dark vocation
Our Order's garb all shall recall
Their final sight before they fall 

BELTS

Echoes of Coldharbour see
In cinctures, sashes, belts
On each hip are tassets three
With hooks for scalps or pelts
