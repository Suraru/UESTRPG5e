Crafting Motif 60: Worm Cult Bows

By the Worm of Songs

In death is life, reanimation
A sacred and a dark vocation
Our Order's garb all shall recall
Their final sight before they fall 

BOWS

From bones defleshed we craft our bows
They loose with bony rattle
The skeletal dart Worm archer throws
Slays men like so much cattle
