Crafting Motif 60: Worm Cult Gloves

By the Worm of Songs

In death is life, reanimation
A sacred and a dark vocation
Our Order's garb all shall recall
Their final sight before they fall 

GLOVES

Our gauntlets guard forearms and hands
Enabling fists to grip
With fingers clad in bony bands
Ensuring hafts don't slip
