Crafting Motif 60: Worm Cult Shields

By the Worm of Songs

In death is life, reanimation
A sacred and a dark vocation
Our Order's garb all shall recall
Their final sight before they fall 

SHIELDS

On Worm Cult shield the horns of Bal
Adorn o'erlapping plates
For undeath is the fate of all
Who pass Coldharbour's gates
