Crafting Motif 60: Worm Cult Staves

By the Worm of Songs

In death is life, reanimation
A sacred and a dark vocation
Our Order's garb all shall recall
Their final sight before they fall 

STAVES

With spellstaff horned like Bal himself
Dark mages focus magic
Thus mortalsâ€”human, beast, or Elf
All meet their endings tragic
