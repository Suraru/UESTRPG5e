Crafting Motif 61: Psijic Gloves

By Loremaster Celarus

The Psijic Order eschews combat, regarding all violence as a failure of negotiation and diplomacy, which are the highest of the non-magical arts. Our garb, therefore, lacks the martial look and feel of most "armor"â€”but that doesn't mean it's any less protective than clanking suits of metal, for powerful protective runes are woven into the very substance of our robes. 

GLOVES

As hands are often extended when spellcasting, our Psijic gauntlets feature strong protection over backhands and forearms. However, the ends of the fingers are exposed so as not to interfere with the intricate gestures some magic requires.
