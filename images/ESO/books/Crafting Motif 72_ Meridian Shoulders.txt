Crafting Motif 72: Meridian Shoulders

By Lady Cinnabar of Taneth

From ancient times till the present, the Cult of Meridia, no matter how often suppressed, always rebounds and reappears. Perhaps this is due to the fact that, for a Daedric Prince, the Lady of Infinite Energies rarely requires genuinely terrible behavior from her worshipers, though she can be severe on those she considers enemies. Mortals who revere her often honor her by adopting an armor style inspired by that of the Aurorans, Meridia's Daedric warriors. This look is so consistent among her cultists in every place and time that one can legitimately say there is a "Meridian" style.

SHOULDERS

Metal provides a perfect medium for artistic touches such as flowing lines that represent the energy of Meridia. Even the lightest armored adherent of Meridia can use the metal shoulder armor to enhance the impact of full-body moves to overwhelm a foe.
