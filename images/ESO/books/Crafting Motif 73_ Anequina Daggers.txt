Crafting Motif 73: Anequina Daggers

By Captain Nala-do, Northern Elsweyr Defense Force

This one is determined to record the traditional appearance of Anequine arms and armor despite the attempts of Euraxia the Usurper Queen to replace them with new, inferior designs. Our martial traditions in the North date back to the time of Darloc Brae, and though nowadays we no longer employ his savage methods, one must confess that the Golden Beast had a truly Khajiiti sense of style in arms and armor. 

DAGGERS

It is rare to catch a Khajiit without a dagger somewhere on their person, whether it be their weapon of choice or a last resort. Hidden in a boot, a dagger can help spring a surprise attack. With a surprise blow, it can kill your enemy instantly. It is of little wonder that the Anequine dagger is created with such care, from its sturdy blade to its deftly balanced handle.
