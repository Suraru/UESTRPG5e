Crafting Motif 74: Pellitine Helmets

By Cashia Khrasaat-Plume, Envoy of the Mane, Torval

While it is an overstatement of the ignorant to characterize we Khajiit as flighty and superficial, it is true that not all of us, like this one, have the gift of precision in speech and writing. It is a worse mistake, but all too common among Tamrielic Men and Mer, to regard Khajiiti civilization as something shallow and recent. This is particularly false as regards the seven kingdoms that became the Federation of Pellitine, a land with a history long and deep. This Servant of the Mane hopes, in the few lines that follow, to cast some light on our Southern Elsweyr military traditions. 

HELMETS

There is no greater weapon on the battlefield than fear. When an enemy's eyes widen and their jaw falls slack with terror, the contest is already decided. To that end, Pellitine helmets all bear the terrifying aspect of a snarling cat-demon.
