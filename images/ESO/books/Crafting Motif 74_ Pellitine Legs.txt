Crafting Motif 74: Pellitine Legs

By Cashia Khrasaat-Plume, Envoy of the Mane, Torval

While it is an overstatement of the ignorant to characterize we Khajiit as flighty and superficial, it is true that not all of us, like this one, have the gift of precision in speech and writing. It is a worse mistake, but all too common among Tamrielic Men and Mer, to regard Khajiiti civilization as something shallow and recent. This is particularly false as regards the seven kingdoms that became the Federation of Pellitine, a land with a history long and deep. This Servant of the Mane hopes, in the few lines that follow, to cast some light on our Southern Elsweyr military traditions. 

LEG GREAVES

As Khibazi the Whirlwind once said, "All fights begin at the thighs." Tailored silken pants provide ample flexibility and protection at the knees, while molded leather greaves protect the upper-legs. Like all elements of the Pellitine panoply, these greaves feature ornate crescents and swirling contours that complement the wearer's inherent grace.
