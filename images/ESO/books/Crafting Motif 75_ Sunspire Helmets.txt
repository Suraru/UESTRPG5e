Crafting Motif 75: Sunspire Helmets

By Azin-jo, Esteemed Bishop of Sunspire

Rejoice, children of Alkosh! After many lean years, the Dragon King of Cats has returned to guide us to glory. We Khajiit are magnificent, yes, with our glistening fangs and silky fur. But to truly honor Alkosh, we must adorn ourselves with a fitting panoplyâ€”armor and weapons that give voice to both Khajiit and Dragon! Therefore, the smith-adepts of Sunspire have created this collection of arms and armor. Each piece bears the First Cat's blessing.

HELMETS

A child of the Dragon King of Cats must be more than a simple Khajiit. They must find their truest heart, where the Dragon within resides. Our helmets' design serves as a constant reminder of our true nature. We are both cat and Dragon. The cat's silhouette crowned by the snarling aspect of blessed Alkosh makes that truth manifest!
