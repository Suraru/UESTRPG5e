Crafting Motif 76: Dragonguard Axes

By Sidura, Navigator of the Perfect Pounce

This one notes that she received permission to look for equipment before she dragged out all the Dragonguard gear on Tideholm. In no way did she gain these items through ill-advised means. Then Sidura spent some time updating and repairing them, with the help of some skilled volunteers. They turned out nicely, yes? Old Dragonguard mixed with new! Dashing and functional!

AXES

Sidura is not one for axes, but if she had to choose? She'd pick the Dragonguard axes. Well-balanced, with ornamental touches picking up on the Dragonguard symbol. Two blades on the two-handed one, and one blade with a sharp poll on the one-handed axe. Poke out a Dragon's eye with that poll!
