Crafting Motif 76: Dragonguard Belts

By Sidura, Navigator of the Perfect Pounce

This one notes that she received permission to look for equipment before she dragged out all the Dragonguard gear on Tideholm. In no way did she gain these items through ill-advised means. Then Sidura spent some time updating and repairing them, with the help of some skilled volunteers. They turned out nicely, yes? Old Dragonguard mixed with new! Dashing and functional!

BELTS

Oh, the detail on the waist gear! Graceful and airy, to Sidura's mind. Protective, too, especially for those midriff swipes. Dragon claw attacks are serious, yes, and better the claw catches on this armor than inside your gut.
