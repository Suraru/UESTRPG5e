Crafting Motif 76: Dragonguard Bows

By Sidura, Navigator of the Perfect Pounce

This one notes that she received permission to look for equipment before she dragged out all the Dragonguard gear on Tideholm. In no way did she gain these items through ill-advised means. Then Sidura spent some time updating and repairing them, with the help of some skilled volunteers. They turned out nicely, yes? Old Dragonguard mixed with new! Dashing and functional!

BOWS

Sidura likes bows to work in close combat as well as ranged, which is why the original Dragonguard bows, with her crew's enhancements, are slick. Smash the bow into your foe's forehead if they get too close! This one made sure it won't break anything but your opponent's skull!
