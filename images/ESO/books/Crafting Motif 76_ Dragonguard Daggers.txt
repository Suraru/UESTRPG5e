Crafting Motif 76: Dragonguard Daggers

By Sidura, Navigator of the Perfect Pounce

This one notes that she received permission to look for equipment before she dragged out all the Dragonguard gear on Tideholm. In no way did she gain these items through ill-advised means. Then Sidura spent some time updating and repairing them, with the help of some skilled volunteers. They turned out nicely, yes? Old Dragonguard mixed with new! Dashing and functional!

DAGGERS

Whether you use one or two daggers when fighting, the Dragonguard dagger allows you to easily catch a foe's weapons or turn away a claw thanks to the quillon's design. Sidura has tested these daggers herself and finds them to be her favorite of all daggers!
