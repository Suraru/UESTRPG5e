Crafting Motif 78: Moongrave Chests

As decreed by Clan Mother Nisaazda

Children, you came to me seeking something greater than the life you were given. This one promised you power beyond your imagining. Through her blood, she has given you only a taste. Soon Nisaazda will show you the heights we can reach. All we must do is follow her chosen Devourer and claim the greatest prey this world has to offer: Dragons. To prepare for this hunt we will learn from the Dragonguard and outfit ourselves accordingly. The trappings of a Hollowfang Dragon hunter are outline herein.

CHESTS

We shall clad ourselves in black and red to honor the Blood Cat on our hunts. Even our lightest cuirasses must be made in the rigid Akaviri style if they are to resist a Dragon's claws. Fashion our bronze as the Dragonguard did, but do not weigh yourself down with excess plates. We are Khajiit, we must remain nimble.
