Crafting Motif 78: Moongrave Legs

As decreed by Clan Mother Nisaazda

Children, you came to me seeking something greater than the life you were given. This one promised you power beyond your imagining. Through her blood, she has given you only a taste. Soon Nisaazda will show you the heights we can reach. All we must do is follow her chosen Devourer and claim the greatest prey this world has to offer: Dragons. To prepare for this hunt we will learn from the Dragonguard and outfit ourselves accordingly. The trappings of a Hollowfang Dragon hunter are outline herein.

LEG GREAVES

Forget the bulky plate of the Devourer. Khajiit must be swift and agile. More swift and agile than a Dragon! Studded leather should suffice. A splint mail skirt at most. Those who don't heed will find themselves in Dragons' teeth.
