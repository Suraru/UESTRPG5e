Crafting Motif 78: Moongrave Maces

As decreed by Clan Mother Nisaazda

Children, you came to me seeking something greater than the life you were given. This one promised you power beyond your imagining. Through her blood, she has given you only a taste. Soon Nisaazda will show you the heights we can reach. All we must do is follow her chosen Devourer and claim the greatest prey this world has to offer: Dragons. To prepare for this hunt we will learn from the Dragonguard and outfit ourselves accordingly. The trappings of a Hollowfang Dragon hunter are outline herein.

MACES

The Devourer has shown us the design of the Dragonguard's scalebreakers. These half-moon faced maces focus their power into a single prominent spike, to pierce and shatter a Dragon's scales.
