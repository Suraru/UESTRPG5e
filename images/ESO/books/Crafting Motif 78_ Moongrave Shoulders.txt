Crafting Motif 78: Moongrave Shoulders

As decreed by Clan Mother Nisaazda

Children, you came to me seeking something greater than the life you were given. This one promised you power beyond your imagining. Through her blood, she has given you only a taste. Soon Nisaazda will show you the heights we can reach. All we must do is follow her chosen Devourer and claim the greatest prey this world has to offer: Dragons. To prepare for this hunt we will learn from the Dragonguard and outfit ourselves accordingly. The trappings of a Hollowfang Dragon hunter are outline herein.

SHOULDERS

What is a Khajiit without a mane? A dull-clawed scavenger. Just as our armor bears our claws and fangs, so too should our collars and shoulders bear our fur. Drape them in the fur of what worthy prey you find among our former kin.
