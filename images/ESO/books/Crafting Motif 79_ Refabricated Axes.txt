Crafting Motif 79: Refabricated Axes

By Dreyla Indavel, Halls of Fabrication

There's a Vehk of a lot of salvage material available if you want to bash together some wicked arms and armor, but there are certain ways the bits fit together for best results. We mainly use parts from those old decommissioned "D-series" Factotums, but there's also a place for more modern Factotum parts, and even some old Dwarven pieces. Here are my recommendations (and I ought to know): 

AXES

For the blade, you're going to want a number 5 flange strutâ€”two of them, for the two-handed axe. The strut's curved side sharpens up real well and holds an edge for quite a while.  For the haft, I recommend the light and durable molybdenum axle from the retired T-class motobarrows.
