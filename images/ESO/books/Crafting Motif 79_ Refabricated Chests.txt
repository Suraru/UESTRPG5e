Crafting Motif 79: Refabricated Chests

By Dreyla Indavel, Halls of Fabrication

There's a Vehk of a lot of salvage material available if you want to bash together some wicked arms and armor, but there are certain ways the bits fit together for best results. We mainly use parts from those old decommissioned "D-series" Factotums, but there's also a place for more modern Factotum parts, and even some old Dwarven pieces. Here are my recommendations (and I ought to know): 

CHESTS

The best Refabricated cuirasses are made by taking D-series Factotum torsos, scouring out the servos, and adding some duraweave gussets to either flank so there's enough room for a citizen to fit inside. You don't even need to add rout embossing to the outer faces, since it comes built in.
