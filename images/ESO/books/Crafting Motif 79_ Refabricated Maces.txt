Crafting Motif 79: Refabricated Maces

By Dreyla Indavel, Halls of Fabrication

There's a Vehk of a lot of salvage material available if you want to bash together some wicked arms and armor, but there are certain ways the bits fit together for best results. We mainly use parts from those old decommissioned "D-series" Factotums, but there's also a place for more modern Factotum parts, and even some old Dwarven pieces. Here are my recommendations (and I ought to know): 

MACES

Find a decommissioned elevator (or, you know, "decommission" one); if you open up the counterweight shaft, you'll find cables strung with oblong weights of a dense metal that I call "heavium" (that's a smithing joke, n'wah). With a little rework, these weights make perfect heads for war hammers.
