Crafting Motif 80: Shield of Senchal Boots

By Centurion Ancrus Vesnentia of the Shields of Senchal, Thirteenth Legion

Southern Elsweyr resisted our arrival when Emperor Aquilarious gave the order. Considering the brutality that plagued the countryside for nearly two decades beforehand, it only makes sense. The Thirteenth Legion prepared for such circumstances, however, and I believe that preparedness won us the trust of the Khajiit over time. We came to restore order to Southern Elsweyr, but we stayed to protect its people. Over time, the Khajiit began to call us the Shields of Senchal. 

BOOTS

The heat in Southern Elsweyr makes open and flexible toed boots highly desirable. After a few dozen cases of what the locals call "Scorch-Paw"-which is just as dreadful as it sounds-we adapted to a more breathable structure. The flexibility of the open toe allows for scaling tougher terrain, as well as maximizing speed.
