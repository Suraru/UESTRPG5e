Crafting Motif 80: Shield of Senchal Chests

By Centurion Ancrus Vesnentia of the Shields of Senchal, Thirteenth Legion

Southern Elsweyr resisted our arrival when Emperor Aquilarious gave the order. Considering the brutality that plagued the countryside for nearly two decades beforehand, it only makes sense. The Thirteenth Legion prepared for such circumstances, however, and I believe that preparedness won us the trust of the Khajiit over time. We came to restore order to Southern Elsweyr, but we stayed to protect its people. Over time, the Khajiit began to call us the Shields of Senchal. 

CHESTS 

You will not find much stiff, metal armor in Southern Elsweyr, and for good reason. The heat and terrain make anything inflexible quite a nightmare. Any metal gets applied sparingly, used most often for embellishments. The Khajiit are fond of their crescents, so we Shields display them proudly.
