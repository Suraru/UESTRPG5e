Crafting Motif 80: Shield of Senchal Gloves

By Centurion Ancrus Vesnentia of the Shields of Senchal, Thirteenth Legion

Southern Elsweyr resisted our arrival when Emperor Aquilarious gave the order. Considering the brutality that plagued the countryside for nearly two decades beforehand, it only makes sense. The Thirteenth Legion prepared for such circumstances, however, and I believe that preparedness won us the trust of the Khajiit over time. We came to restore order to Southern Elsweyr, but we stayed to protect its people. Over time, the Khajiit began to call us the Shields of Senchal. 

GLOVES

Southern Elsweyr bears the mark of Imperial influence, but the opposite rings true as well. We Imperials may not have claws like our feline neighbors, but our gloves still allow the freedom and flexibility as if that were the case. Our soldiers handle their weapons with greater efficiency and boast hard-won callouses as a result.
