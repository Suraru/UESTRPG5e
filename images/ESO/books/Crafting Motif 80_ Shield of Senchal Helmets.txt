Crafting Motif 80: Shield of Senchal Helmets

By Centurion Ancrus Vesnentia of the Shields of Senchal, Thirteenth Legion

Southern Elsweyr resisted our arrival when Emperor Aquilarious gave the order. Considering the brutality that plagued the countryside for nearly two decades beforehand, it only makes sense. The Thirteenth Legion prepared for such circumstances, however, and I believe that preparedness won us the trust of the Khajiit over time. We came to restore order to Southern Elsweyr, but we stayed to protect its people. Over time, the Khajiit began to call us the Shields of Senchal. 

HELMETS

Visibility cannot be discounted as a component to survival, especially in this untamed environment. We reserve our face-covering helmets for our front-line soldiers, fashioned out of pliant metal with the likeness of the Legate Autrus, the hero who singlehandedly launched an attack on the enemy commander in the Battle of Xaseear. Most fighters prefer an open-faced helmet, however, with protective leather inlay to provide both flexibility and some relief from the heat.
