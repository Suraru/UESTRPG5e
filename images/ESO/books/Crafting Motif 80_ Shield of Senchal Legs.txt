Crafting Motif 80: Shield of Senchal Legs

By Centurion Ancrus Vesnentia of the Shields of Senchal, Thirteenth Legion

Southern Elsweyr resisted our arrival when Emperor Aquilarious gave the order. Considering the brutality that plagued the countryside for nearly two decades beforehand, it only makes sense. The Thirteenth Legion prepared for such circumstances, however, and I believe that preparedness won us the trust of the Khajiit over time. We came to restore order to Southern Elsweyr, but we stayed to protect its people. Over time, the Khajiit began to call us the Shields of Senchal. 

LEG GREAVES

Supple molded leather, metal casing where appropriate, and airy fabric for the interior make the perfect recipe for success. Material for the legs must be open and non-restrictive to allow for movement, while also maintaining proper protection. You don't want to brush up against the wrong side of a Glyptodon without something between you and it, after all.
