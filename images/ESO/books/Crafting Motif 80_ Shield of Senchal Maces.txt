Crafting Motif 80: Shield of Senchal Maces

By Centurion Ancrus Vesnentia of the Shields of Senchal, Thirteenth Legion

Southern Elsweyr resisted our arrival when Emperor Aquilarious gave the order. Considering the brutality that plagued the countryside for nearly two decades beforehand, it only makes sense. The Thirteenth Legion prepared for such circumstances, however, and I believe that preparedness won us the trust of the Khajiit over time. We came to restore order to Southern Elsweyr, but we stayed to protect its people. Over time, the Khajiit began to call us the Shields of Senchal. 

MACES

Not everyone shares my passion for the mace, but no one argues that it makes a statement. Though not precise as a blade, it still strikes both fear and awe in ones enemies. Bronze faces decorate the head of the weapon. They become a particularly frightening sight once spattered with blood, as if the faces themselves enjoy drinking it. Some soldiers swear they even grin.
