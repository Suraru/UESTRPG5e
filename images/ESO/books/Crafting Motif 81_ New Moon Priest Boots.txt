Crafting Motif 81: New Moon Priest Boots

By Fadai, Arcane Quartermaster, Order of the New Moon

Some believe that the Order of the New Moon grows too quickly. The fear and confusion felt upon witnessing the rage of Dragons has led many into our ranks. This one says the newcomers should be embraced! Lord Laatvulon offers his protection to all wise enough to accept it. Of course, production of the required priestly garments will need to increase. Fadai gladly offers guidance on crafting vestments and how best to incorporate the aeonstones into their designs.

BOOTS

Typical priesthoods adhere to open-toed sandals to demonstrate humility before their gods. While we do offer such a design, our labors for Laatvulon often require more aggressive protection. Many will find the heavy steel plating useful when crushing nonbelievers underfoot.
