Crafting Motif 81: New Moon Priest Maces

By Fadai, Arcane Quartermaster, Order of the New Moon

Some believe that the Order of the New Moon grows too quickly. The fear and confusion felt upon witnessing the rage of Dragons has led many into our ranks. This one says the newcomers should be embraced! Lord Laatvulon offers his protection to all wise enough to accept it. Of course, production of the required priestly garments will need to increase. Fadai gladly offers guidance on crafting vestments and how best to incorporate the aeonstones into their designs.

MACES

A series of sharp blades resembling a Dragon's majestic wings ring the head of our maces. We intend these to be as instructive as they are decorative. The blades bite and tear like lord Laatvulon's jaw, so that the victim remembers exactly who the wielder represents.
