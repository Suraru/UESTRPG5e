Crafting Motif 84: Blackreach Vanguard Legs

By Captain Thromkir of the Blackreach Vanguard of Dusktown

The few brave enough to venture to Blackreach found themselves in need of specialized protection early on. While this place remains unpredictable, it has a wealth of resources that are easily harvested and can be turned against it. Much of the process is still trial and error, but it's been refined to a point where I believe it's pertinent to take record of. I imagine the longer people exist in Blackreach, the more nuanced these practices will become. 

LEG GREAVES
Vale deer are abundant, despite being easy prey for the local fauna. Their numbers dwindle by the day, unfortunately, but for now there are enough to provide us with material. Many of the greaves worn by the Blackreach Vanguard are made from their hides. The leather makes for heavy, tough protection that tends to be flexible enough for quick movement and traversing the uneven terrain.
