Crafting Motif 85: Greymoor Axes

By Captain Viddgryr, Guard of Solitude 

The Gray Host needs little introduction. The ancient army, risen anew, plagues our lands with little regard for the lives they take. I believe it is important for us to know our enemy. Many have clashed blades with these terrors, but are woefully misinformed about their weapons and armor. Here, I intend to make a detailed account of everything we know about the Gray Host's armaments in hopes that those who read will be better prepared.

AXES
The Host's axes are quite fearsome. Giant twin fangs emblazoned in gold make a terrifying arch of destruction. Like most of their weaponry, there is an elegance to the axe that might lead you to believe it isn't as lethal as it truly is. Do not let the beauty fool you.
