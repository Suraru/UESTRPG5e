Crafting Motif 85: Greymoor Belts

By Captain Viddgryr, Guard of Solitude 

The Gray Host needs little introduction. The ancient army, risen anew, plagues our lands with little regard for the lives they take. I believe it is important for us to know our enemy. Many have clashed blades with these terrors, but are woefully misinformed about their weapons and armor. Here, I intend to make a detailed account of everything we know about the Gray Host's armaments in hopes that those who read will be better prepared.

BELTS
Golden bat figures feature prominently on the Gray Host's belts. The designs vary, but the spread wings are consistent throughout. They seem more decorative than functional, possibly to emphasize the grandiose style the Gray Host adheres to.
