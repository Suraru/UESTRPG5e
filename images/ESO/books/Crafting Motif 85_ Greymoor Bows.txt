Crafting Motif 85: Greymoor Bows

By Captain Viddgryr, Guard of Solitude 

The Gray Host needs little introduction. The ancient army, risen anew, plagues our lands with little regard for the lives they take. I believe it is important for us to know our enemy. Many have clashed blades with these terrors, but are woefully misinformed about their weapons and armor. Here, I intend to make a detailed account of everything we know about the Gray Host's armaments in hopes that those who read will be better prepared.

BOWS
The Gray Host craft their bows with such magnificence, it's enviable. Gilded, arched wings decorate both the quivers and bows themselves. The combination makes a simple form of combat into something darkly beautiful and fearsome to behold on the battlefield.
