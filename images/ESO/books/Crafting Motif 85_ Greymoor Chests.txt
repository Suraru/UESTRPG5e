Crafting Motif 85: Greymoor Chests

By Captain Viddgryr, Guard of Solitude 

The Gray Host needs little introduction. The ancient army, risen anew, plagues our lands with little regard for the lives they take. I believe it is important for us to know our enemy. Many have clashed blades with these terrors, but are woefully misinformed about their weapons and armor. Here, I intend to make a detailed account of everything we know about the Gray Host's armaments in hopes that those who read will be better prepared.

CHESTS
Each Gray Host member's chest displays a golden sigil. Some designs spread out along the entirety of the chest; others are focused into smaller pieces directly in the center. Against the dark, inky black of the rest of their armor, the shine stands out and commands respect.
