Crafting Motif 85: Greymoor Gloves

By Captain Viddgryr, Guard of Solitude 

The Gray Host needs little introduction. The ancient army, risen anew, plagues our lands with little regard for the lives they take. I believe it is important for us to know our enemy. Many have clashed blades with these terrors, but are woefully misinformed about their weapons and armor. Here, I intend to make a detailed account of everything we know about the Gray Host's armaments in hopes that those who read will be better prepared.

GLOVES
Dark leather makes the hands of the Gray Host near invisible in the night. You might catch a flash of gold under the moonlight before a killing blow, but that is all.
