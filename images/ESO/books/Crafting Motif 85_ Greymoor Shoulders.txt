Crafting Motif 85: Greymoor Shoulders

By Captain Viddgryr, Guard of Solitude 

The Gray Host needs little introduction. The ancient army, risen anew, plagues our lands with little regard for the lives they take. I believe it is important for us to know our enemy. Many have clashed blades with these terrors, but are woefully misinformed about their weapons and armor. Here, I intend to make a detailed account of everything we know about the Gray Host's armaments in hopes that those who read will be better prepared.

SHOULDERS
Golden pauldrons, sharp as the vampire's fangs, decorate the shoulders of the Gray Host army. They extend far past the actual shoulders of any soldier, making them appear taller, wider and more formidable. The edges look nearly as sharp as the army's swords.
