Crafting Motif 85: Greymoor Swords

By Captain Viddgryr, Guard of Solitude 

The Gray Host needs little introduction. The ancient army, risen anew, plagues our lands with little regard for the lives they take. I believe it is important for us to know our enemy. Many have clashed blades with these terrors, but are woefully misinformed about their weapons and armor. Here, I intend to make a detailed account of everything we know about the Gray Host's armaments in hopes that those who read will be better prepared.

SWORDS                        
Much like the daggers the Host uses, their swords tend to be thin, delicate â€¦ almost needle-like in appearance. They are no less dangerous, however. The metal is sturdy enough to pierce through flesh and muscle, and with it being so thin, you might never see it coming.
