Crafting Motif 86: Sea Giant Belts

By Varcent Eardrey

We know very little about Sea Giants. What scraps of information about the elusive species we've gleaned thus far certainly fail to paint a clear picture. We're reasonably certain that Sea Giants are fearsome hunters, as harvesting great whales could be no easy task. That they stay such a mystery and point of terror for many seafaring Nords should be more than enough of an incentive to try to integrate their techniques into our own.

BELTS
Those who claim to have seen Sea Giants in the flesh describe clothing festooned with skulls and long, serrated teeth. The skull of a sabre cat would look as small as a bird's skull on such a large creature. Despite our smaller frame, we can still use such adornments. Bird skulls and slaughterfish teeth would make equally terrifying additions to our belts.
