Crafting Motif 86: Sea Giant Boots

By Varcent Eardrey

We know very little about Sea Giants. What scraps of information about the elusive species we've gleaned thus far certainly fail to paint a clear picture. We're reasonably certain that Sea Giants are fearsome hunters, as harvesting great whales could be no easy task. That they stay such a mystery and point of terror for many seafaring Nords should be more than enough of an incentive to try to integrate their techniques into our own.

BOOTS
From what we can tell, Sea Giants use a great deal of bone in their weaponry. Logic dictates that they also use such methods in their clothing, minimal as it is. Whale bone makes for especially good structural support in footwear, as well as a strong offensive component when placed on the outside of the shin.
