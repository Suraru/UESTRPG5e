Crafting Motif 86: Sea Giant Bows

By Varcent Eardrey

We know very little about Sea Giants. What scraps of information about the elusive species we've gleaned thus far certainly fail to paint a clear picture. We're reasonably certain that Sea Giants are fearsome hunters, as harvesting great whales could be no easy task. That they stay such a mystery and point of terror for many seafaring Nords should be more than enough of an incentive to try to integrate their techniques into our own.

BOWS
Carved bone adds weight to bows, as well as stability. It's not clear whether Sea Giants themselves use bows or any kind of ranged weaponry, but if they did, I imagine it would be something like a quiver made from horker leather and arrows tipped with feathers from the wings of seafaring birds.
