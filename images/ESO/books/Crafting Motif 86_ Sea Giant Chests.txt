Crafting Motif 86: Sea Giant Chests

By Varcent Eardrey

We know very little about Sea Giants. What scraps of information about the elusive species we've gleaned thus far certainly fail to paint a clear picture. We're reasonably certain that Sea Giants are fearsome hunters, as harvesting great whales could be no easy task. That they stay such a mystery and point of terror for many seafaring Nords should be more than enough of an incentive to try to integrate their techniques into our own.

CHESTS
Sailors often trade tales of the Sea Giants' fish scale armor. While the origin of these massive scales remains a frightful mystery, they no doubt make for stout protection. Sewing these plates into the chests of boiled leather armor pieces provides an incredibly solid line of protection.
