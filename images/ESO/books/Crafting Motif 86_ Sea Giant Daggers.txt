Crafting Motif 86: Sea Giant Daggers

By Varcent Eardrey

We know very little about Sea Giants. What scraps of information about the elusive species we've gleaned thus far certainly fail to paint a clear picture. We're reasonably certain that Sea Giants are fearsome hunters, as harvesting great whales could be no easy task. That they stay such a mystery and point of terror for many seafaring Nords should be more than enough of an incentive to try to integrate their techniques into our own.

DAGGERS
Sea Giants themselves likely use crude daggers, or what we would call short swords. From the evidence we've seen in whale carcasses, long slashes and cuts signal the use of blades. If we take anything from their inspiration, it should be the sheer slashing power of the blade and supple horker leather at the hilt.
