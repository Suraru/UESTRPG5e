Crafting Motif 86: Sea Giant Maces

By Varcent Eardrey

We know very little about Sea Giants. What scraps of information about the elusive species we've gleaned thus far certainly fail to paint a clear picture. We're reasonably certain that Sea Giants are fearsome hunters, as harvesting great whales could be no easy task. That they stay such a mystery and point of terror for many seafaring Nords should be more than enough of an incentive to try to integrate their techniques into our own.

MACES
Those who claim to witness Sea Giants out upon the water describe terrifying figureheads at the bows of their vessels. Descriptions range from horrible gargoyles to ugly depictions of what might be horkers. No one knows for certain if these exist, but the concept makes for interesting mace design. Four figureheads with fierce faces, turned out, ready to clobber their enemies!
