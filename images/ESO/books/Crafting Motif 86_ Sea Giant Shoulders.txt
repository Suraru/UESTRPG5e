Crafting Motif 86: Sea Giant Shoulders

By Varcent Eardrey

We know very little about Sea Giants. What scraps of information about the elusive species we've gleaned thus far certainly fail to paint a clear picture. We're reasonably certain that Sea Giants are fearsome hunters, as harvesting great whales could be no easy task. That they stay such a mystery and point of terror for many seafaring Nords should be more than enough of an incentive to try to integrate their techniques into our own.

SHOULDERS
We have no verified accounts of Sea Giant ships, but one would have to surmise that they are massive. To hold a hunting party of such size would take a colossal vessel. Armor can inspire the same kind of wonder. Imagine shoulder pauldrons with ship figureheads carved in miniature out of bone, to make the wearer a vessel themselves.
