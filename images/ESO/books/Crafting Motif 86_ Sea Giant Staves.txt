Crafting Motif 86: Sea Giant Staves

By Varcent Eardrey

We know very little about Sea Giants. What scraps of information about the elusive species we've gleaned thus far certainly fail to paint a clear picture. We're reasonably certain that Sea Giants are fearsome hunters, as harvesting great whales could be no easy task. That they stay such a mystery and point of terror for many seafaring Nords should be more than enough of an incentive to try to integrate their techniques into our own.

STAVES
I'd stake my reputation on the theory that Sea Giants aren't magic users. Even so, taking their affinity for bone into account, we can fashion our staves into fearsome imitations of what the Sea Giants' might look like. The skulls of small animals might decorate the top, with larger pieces of bones carved thin like sails to spread out and inspire terror in any unfortunate enough to warrant the wielder's ire.
