Crafting Motif 86: Sea Giant Swords

By Varcent Eardrey

We know very little about Sea Giants. What scraps of information about the elusive species we've gleaned thus far certainly fail to paint a clear picture. We're reasonably certain that Sea Giants are fearsome hunters, as harvesting great whales could be no easy task. That they stay such a mystery and point of terror for many seafaring Nords should be more than enough of an incentive to try to integrate their techniques into our own.

SWORDS
Our swords would be mere daggers in Sea Giant hands, but surely even they could appreciate the use of horker leather around the hilt and decorative bone carvings along the pommel. While we may not be jumping into the sea to deliver a fatal blow to a great whale, we can use these mysterious creatures as inspiration during our own battles.
