Crafting Motif 87: Ancestral Nord Swords

By Bjarnus Whitewhiskers

Twas the year one hundred and forty-three of the First Era when Harald, thirteenth in the line of Ysgramor, did relinquish all claims to the holdings of his storied line in the land of his birth and, by birth and by conquest, did assume the mantle of High King to found his own kingdom in Tamriel: the Kingdom of Skyrim. To commemorate the vanquishing of the Elves and the unification of Men under his banner, Harald commissioned every craftsworker in his new land to outfit his warriors and forge the first army of Nords.

SWORDS

The long blades of Harald's army sprouted like towering oaks from hilts the shape of troll horns, ready to come down on the heads of his enemies with all the force of a felled tree. And so they did, as his armies continued to expand the boundaries of Skyrim's holds.
