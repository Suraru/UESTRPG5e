Crafting Motif 88: Ancestral Orc Helmets

By Armelle Menant, Historian of Glenumbra

The Orcs are a proud people, a race supposedly birthed from the strongest of the Elven Divines after he was corrupted by the Daedric Prince, Boethiah. Feared outcasts for most of their history, Orcs—and their mark upon Tamriel—is one that we ignore at our peril! We cannot discuss their history without observing the evolution of Orsinium throughout time. The first iteration came in the First Era when it became a refuge for Orcs under the chieftain Torug gro-Igron. A civilization flourished, and the master smiths of this new nation outfitted their warriors in armor worthy of their strength.

HELMETS
Few elements of the Orcish panoply match the distinctive aesthetic of these early warriors' helms. Carved with impressive attention to detail, the Orcs depicted callous faces in the metalwork. Pointed bronze tusks served no practical purpose other than to remind enemies who exactly they were dealing with. An army of dark, seething faces surely inspired a great deal of fear.
