Crafting Motif 88: Ancestral Orc Staves

By Armelle Menant, Historian of Glenumbra

The Orcs are a proud people, a race supposedly birthed from the strongest of the Elven Divines after he was corrupted by the Daedric Prince, Boethiah. Feared outcasts for most of their history, Orcs—and their mark upon Tamriel—is one that we ignore at our peril! We cannot discuss their history without observing the evolution of Orsinium throughout time. The first iteration came in the First Era when it became a refuge for Orcs under the chieftain Torug gro-Igron. A civilization flourished, and the master smiths of this new nation outfitted their warriors in armor worthy of their strength.

STAVES
It makes this researcher chuckle to know that the staves of the Orcs looked suspiciously close to their maces. Though not quite as deadly, the most commonly used staff still had a hefty metal block at its apex. Much design work went into the carving of the Orcish face at the base of this block, and though it was small, I imagine it must have been quite terrifying to see one towering above a group and finding you in its silvery gaze.
