Crafting Motif 89: Ancestral High Elf Axes

With the need for armed combatants to fight against the Alessian Empire, armor and weapon artisans like yourselves craft tirelessly. Unfortunately, your varied artistic visions rob the army of a cohesive aesthetic. As every Elf knows, war without grace is the province of men. I, for one, cannot abide such a comparison. Therefore, all smiths must henceforth adhere to the specific style, outlined below, when fashioning arms and armor.

AXES

Those wielding axes among our forces deserve more than a logger's implement, but one mustn't overlook utility when in the field. All axes must curve in a manner that emulates the wing (or wings, in the case of the two-handed axe) of an eagle in flight. Wood smoothed with sanded paper sourced from Summerset makes up the haft, which should be bound in supple, interwoven straps of leather.
