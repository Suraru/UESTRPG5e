Crafting Motif 89: Ancestral High Elf Bows

With the need for armed combatants to fight against the Alessian Empire, armor and weapon artisans like yourselves craft tirelessly. Unfortunately, your varied artistic visions rob the army of a cohesive aesthetic. As every Elf knows, war without grace is the province of men. I, for one, cannot abide such a comparison. Therefore, all smiths must henceforth adhere to the specific style, outlined below, when fashioning arms and armor.

BOWS

After last year's debacle, we must prioritize function over form with our bows and quivers. The metal guards of Auri-El's eagle on the upper and lower limbs should appear graceful, but must not interfere with the weapon's draw. These guards should also provide archers with a means to dispatch melee foes. The quiver should take the form of a bird's wing, crafted in matching metal.
