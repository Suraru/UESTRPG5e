Crafting Motif 89: Ancestral High Elf Chests

With the need for armed combatants to fight against the Alessian Empire, armor and weapon artisans like yourselves craft tirelessly. Unfortunately, your varied artistic visions rob the army of a cohesive aesthetic. As every Elf knows, war without grace is the province of Men. I, for one, cannot abide such a comparison. Therefore, all smiths must henceforth adhere to the specific style, outlined below, when fashioning arms and armor.

â€”Raven Direnni

CHESTS

The fully glory of flight dominates every piece of chest gear. Our soldiers may wade through muck and viscera to face certain death on the battlefield, but when they look upon each other, they need to be reminded of who they fight for, and what they fight for. Make their hearts soar! And let us hope that the gear protects their literal hearts from the primitive fury of Men.
