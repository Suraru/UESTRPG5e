Crafting Motif 89: Ancestral High Elf Daggers

With the need for armed combatants to fight against the Alessian Empire, armor and weapon artisans like yourselves craft tirelessly. Unfortunately, your varied artistic visions rob the army of a cohesive aesthetic. As every Elf knows, war without grace is the province of men. I, for one, cannot abide such a comparison. Therefore, all smiths must henceforth adhere to the specific style, outlined below, when fashioning arms and armor.

DAGGERS

When any look upon our daggers, they should be reminded of our sharp minds, our deadly prowess, and our elegance. But only for a brief moment. Then? They should be dead or wounded, as the wielder wishes. Continue to use the swoop of a bird's wing in your crafting of these deadliest of small war-pieces, and ensure that a bird's head graces the pommel.
