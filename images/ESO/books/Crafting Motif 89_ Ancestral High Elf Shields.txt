Crafting Motif 89: Ancestral High Elf Shields

With the need for armed combatants to fight against the Alessian Empire, armor and weapon artisans like yourselves craft tirelessly. Unfortunately, your varied artistic visions rob the army of a cohesive aesthetic. As every Elf knows, war without grace is the province of men. I, for one, cannot abide such a comparison. Therefore, all smiths must henceforth adhere to the specific style, outlined below, when fashioning arms and armor.

SHIELDS

Made of metal, our shields integrate feathering and eagle head styles, expressing our reverence for Auri-El as well as acknowledging the tenacity and freedom of our people. Make them heavy enough to lay low any foes unfortunate enough to receive a blow from one, but light enough to not drag the wings of our troops!
