Crafting Motif 90: Thorn Legion Belts

By Lendantare, Outfitter Extraordinaire

To the majestic and most gracious Lady Thorn of Western Skyrimâ€”

This letter serves as formal notice that my contract with you is now complete and that I have fully delivered the requested items. I speak truly when I say that your hospitality exceeds that of most kings and queens that I've served. Your servants have shown more courtesy than I expected from those with their nature. It is quite the shame we could not meet in person. I hope you'll allow me to boast that this may be my finest work yet.

BELTS
In these cold climes, keeping your clothes tight can help maintain the body's heat. I designed the belts to wrap your servants so well they shall barely feel the bite of frost yet will stay as comfortable as a satin nightgown.
