Crafting Motif 90: Thorn Legion Chests

By Lendantare, Outfitter Extraordinaire

To the majestic and most gracious Lady Thorn of Western Skyrimâ€”

This letter serves as formal notice that my contract with you is now complete and that I have fully delivered the requested items. I speak truly when I say that your hospitality exceeds that of most kings and queens that I've served. Your servants have shown more courtesy than I expected from those with their nature. It is quite the shame we could not meet in person. I hope you'll allow me to boast that this may be my finest work yet.

CHESTS
I must have worn a unique cologne on the day that I measured your guards for these pieces.
Several of them audibly sniffed me as I approached. When I asked one gentleman, he smiled and merely said I smelled delicious. Hopefully, the lightweight metal plating across the chest and delicate fur lining offers enough comfort to reward your man for his compliment!
