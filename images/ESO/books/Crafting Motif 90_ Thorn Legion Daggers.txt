Crafting Motif 90: Thorn Legion Daggers

By Lendantare, Outfitter Extraordinaire

To the majestic and most gracious Lady Thorn of Western Skyrimâ€”

This letter serves as formal notice that my contract with you is now complete and that I have fully delivered the requested items. I speak truly when I say that your hospitality exceeds that of most kings and queens that I've served. Your servants have shown more courtesy than I expected from those with their nature. It is quite the shame we could not meet in person. I hope you'll allow me to boast that this may be my finest work yet.

DAGGERS
Many see daggers as simple, utilitarian items. I disagree. They are sly, secretive weapons that hide until the very moment when they strike! Although I added a stylized pommel that matches the edge of your family name, the sleek blade maintains the weapon's secretive nature.
