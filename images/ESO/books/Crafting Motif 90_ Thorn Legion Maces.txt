Crafting Motif 90: Thorn Legion Maces

By Lendantare, Outfitter Extraordinaire

To the majestic and most gracious Lady Thorn of Western Skyrimâ€”

This letter serves as formal notice that my contract with you is now complete and that I have fully delivered the requested items. I speak truly when I say that your hospitality exceeds that of most kings and queens that I've served. Your servants have shown more courtesy than I expected from those with their nature. It is quite the shame we could not meet in person. I hope you'll allow me to boast that this may be my finest work yet.

MACES
Although intended mainly for bashing, I experimented here with a pointed design that should puncture and grip the target on contact. This mace's "bite", as I call it, will tear off armor or flesh that it makes contact with. Perhaps too gruesome for some, but you did not contract me to create gentle weaponry.
