Crafting Motif 90: Thorn Legion Shields

By Lendantare, Outfitter Extraordinaire

To the majestic and most gracious Lady Thorn of Western Skyrimâ€”

This letter serves as formal notice that my contract with you is now complete and that I have fully delivered the requested items. I speak truly when I say that your hospitality exceeds that of most kings and queens that I've served. Your servants have shown more courtesy than I expected from those with their nature. It is quite the shame we could not meet in person. I hope you'll allow me to boast that this may be my finest work yet.

SHIELDS
While drawing up some ideas for these shields, I asked your porter for information on your family line so I might incorporate a crest. He chuckled softly and replied that no such crest existed. But he added if one were to exist, he imagined they would be a massive pair of wings. I assumed he referred to your affection for bats.
