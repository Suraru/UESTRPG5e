Crafting Motif 90: Thorn Legion Swords

By Lendantare, Outfitter Extraordinaire

To the majestic and most gracious Lady Thorn of Western Skyrim—

This letter serves as formal notice that my contract with you is now complete and that I have fully delivered the requested items. I speak truly when I say that your hospitality exceeds that of most kings and queens that I've served. Your servants have shown more courtesy than I expected from those with their nature. It is quite the shame we could not meet in person. I hope you'll allow me to boast that this may be my finest work yet.

SWORDS
The most common and visible weapon of your guardsmen should also be the most visibly associated with their leader. I designed the sleek blade to reflect your own elegance, while again representing the bats you love on the pommel. Simple and timeless design—all should know it represents you.
