Crafting Motif 91: Hazardous Alchemy Axes

To be fabricated precisely to the exacting standards of the unmatched genius Arkasis!

Stone Garden proves to be an ideal location to conduct my experiments undisturbed by the average—by an astonishingly low statistical mode—inhabitants of this bumpkin land. However, it also drastically limits my access to expendable workers. To address the rate of attrition of my now limited supply of assistants, I have developed protective equipment that should reduce unnecessary fatalities and outlast the typical tenure of these peons by a factor of ten.

AXES
I require a heavy range of axes to facilitate vivisection of larger specimens. The curvature of the blade is ideal for flensing and the degree of angle allows for effective scraping of viscera off surfaces and out of corners.
