Crafting Motif 91: Hazardous Alchemy Helmets

To be fabricated precisely to the exacting standards of the unmatched genius Arkasis!

Stone Garden proves to be an ideal location to conduct my experiments undisturbed by the average—by an astonishingly low statistical mode—inhabitants of this bumpkin land. However, it also drastically limits my access to expendable workers. To address the rate of attrition of my now limited supply of assistants, I have developed protective equipment that should reduce unnecessary fatalities and outlast the typical tenure of these peons by a factor of ten.

HELMETS
The high-density fiber masks I provided ARE MANDATORY and easily fit all uniform cowls and headgear. They are tailor made to filter harmful airborne materials and prevent contamination of my equipment from whatever filth you excrement eating dim-wits dribble from your slack jaws.
