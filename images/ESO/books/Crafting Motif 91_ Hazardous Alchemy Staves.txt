Crafting Motif 91: Hazardous Alchemy Staves

To be fabricated precisely to the exacting standards of the unmatched genius Arkasis!

Stone Garden proves to be an ideal location to conduct my experiments undisturbed by the average—by an astonishingly low statistical mode—inhabitants of this bumpkin land. However, it also drastically limits my access to expendable workers. To address the rate of attrition of my now limited supply of assistants, I have developed protective equipment that should reduce unnecessary fatalities and outlast the typical tenure of these peons by a factor of ten.

STAVES
The few of you with a shred of magical talent will find this staff ideally suited to the efficient conduction of Magicka and Dwemer tonal harmonics. Do not lean on it.
