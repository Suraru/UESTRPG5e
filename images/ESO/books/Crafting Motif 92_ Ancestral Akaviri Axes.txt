Crafting Motif 92: Ancestral Akaviri Axes

By Caelius Calogerus, Imperial Captain

We halted the Akaviri forces at Pale Pass. I thought that would be the end of it, but none could have anticipated what transpired. The hush over the land as the blood cooled and the Akaviri, hearing the voice of Reman Cyrodiil, knelt and swore to serve him. Now, those remaining raiders are part of our army. They fight alongside us. These are strange times, but we will only weaken ourselves with infighting. I am writing this account to try and better understand these Tsaesci warriors. I think it prudent to begin with their martial knowledge first.

AXES

While the Akaviri's axes do not look much different from our own at a distance, to see them up close is another matter entirely. Intricate carvings of heavy whorls splay out along the head of the weapon. The end result is as beautiful as the edges are sharp.
