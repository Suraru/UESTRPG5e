Crafting Motif 92: Ancestral Akaviri Bows

By Caelius Calogerus, Imperial Captain

We halted the Akaviri forces at Pale Pass. I thought that would be the end of it, but none could have anticipated what transpired. The hush over the land as the blood cooled and the Akaviri, hearing the voice of Reman Cyrodiil, knelt and swore to serve him. Now, those remaining raiders are part of our army. They fight alongside us. These are strange times, but we will only weaken ourselves with infighting. I am writing this account to try and better understand these Tsaesci warriors. I think it prudent to begin with their martial knowledge first.

BOWS

The Akaviri bows are much heftier than our own. The overall shape of the bow is similar, but it feels heavier to the touch and holds up against a great deal of punishment. It looks like it was born in a blacksmith's forge, not carved by delicate hands.
