Crafting Motif 92: Ancestral Akaviri Legs

By Caelius Calogerus, Imperial Captain

We halted the Akaviri forces at Pale Pass. I thought that would be the end of it, but none could have anticipated what transpired. The hush over the land as the blood cooled and the Akaviri, hearing the voice of Reman Cyrodiil, knelt and swore to serve him. Now, those remaining raiders are part of our army. They fight alongside us. These are strange times, but we will only weaken ourselves with infighting. I am writing this account to try and better understand these Tsaesci warriors. I think it prudent to begin with their martial knowledge first.

LEG GREAVES
Our new soldiers tend to keep their legs free and the material around them loose. Whatever protection they deem necessary is usually affixed to the waist and is allowed to drape down. I imagine this flexibility is what makes them move so quickly across a battlefield.
