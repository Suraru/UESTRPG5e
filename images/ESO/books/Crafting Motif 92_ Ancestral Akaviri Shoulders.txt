Crafting Motif 92: Ancestral Akaviri Shoulders

We halted the Akaviri forces at Pale Pass. I thought that would be the end of it, but none could have anticipated what transpired. The hush over the land as the blood cooled and the Akaviri, hearing the voice of Reman Cyrodiil, knelt and swore to serve him. Now, those remaining raiders are part of our army. They fight alongside us. These are strange times, but we will only weaken ourselves with infighting. I am writing this account to try and better understand these Tsaesci warriors. I think it prudent to begin with their martial knowledge first.

SHOULDERS
The Akaviri fashion their shoulder pauldrons out of strong, but moldable material. They allow for full rotation of the shoulder while still managing to protect the wearer from attack. Often, this material is layered in horizontal rows and strung together tightly to make a whole piece.
