Crafting Motif 94: Ancestral Reach Bows

By Lieutenant Abrienna Nestoro, Imperial Legion

Reachman warriors are known far and wide for their ferocity in battle and the primitiveness of their arms and armor. Few Reachmen smelt iron, let alone steel, and at its best Reachman metalwork is poorly made. Instead, Reachman rely on materials provided by nature to fashion their weapons: wood, stone, hide, and bone. During Empress Hestra's recent campaign to establish Imperial rule in the Reach, we learned that a Reachman's hide shield can stop a hard-driven arrow just as well as steel-bossed birchwood, and an axe fashioned from the shoulderblade of a Druadach bear can part the links of light mail. Primitive, yesâ€”but effective as well.   

BOWS
A Reachman's bow is a hunting tool first and foremost. It is usually lightly built from glued-together layers of wood, horn, and bone, but surprisingly powerful for its small size and weight. Arrowheads are usually flaked stone or carved bone. The light arrow doesn't carry well for distance shooting, but at close range it can pierce heavy mail.
