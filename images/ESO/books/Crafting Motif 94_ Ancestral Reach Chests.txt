Crafting Motif 94: Ancestral Reach Chests

By Lieutenant Abrienna Nestoro, Imperial Legion

Reachman warriors are known far and wide for their ferocity in battle and the primitiveness of their arms and armor. Few Reachmen smelt iron, let alone steel, and at its best Reachman metalwork is poorly made. Instead, Reachman rely on materials provided by nature to fashion their weapons: wood, stone, hide, and bone. During Empress Hestra's recent campaign to establish Imperial rule in the Reach, we learned that a Reachman's hide shield can stop a hard-driven arrow just as well as steel-bossed birchwood, and an axe fashioned from the shoulderblade of a Druadach bear can part the links of light mail. Primitive, yesâ€”but effective as well.   

CHESTS
Hide and leather are the armor of a Reachman. For light protection, a single layer of toughened leather suffices, while heavier armor consists of multiple layers of boiled leather and thick, cured hide.
