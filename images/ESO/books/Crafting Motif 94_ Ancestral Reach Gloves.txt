Crafting Motif 94: Ancestral Reach Gloves

By Lieutenant Abrienna Nestoro, Imperial Legion

Reachman warriors are known far and wide for their ferocity in battle and the primitiveness of their arms and armor. Few Reachmen smelt iron, let alone steel, and at its best Reachman metalwork is poorly made. Instead, Reachman rely on materials provided by nature to fashion their weapons: wood, stone, hide, and bone. During Empress Hestra's recent campaign to establish Imperial rule in the Reach, we learned that a Reachman's hide shield can stop a hard-driven arrow just as well as steel-bossed birchwood, and an axe fashioned from the shoulderblade of a Druadach bear can part the links of light mail. Primitive, yesâ€”but effective as well.   

GLOVES
Reachmen prefer open-fingered hand wrappings to full gloves. Gloves are simply tedious and time-consuming to sew, and hide or fleece mittens are easy enough to put on in cold weather. Supple, well-cured leather is preferred for handwear, although some warriors add studs or spikes of carved bone across the knuckles. One never knows when a fist in the face might be called for.
