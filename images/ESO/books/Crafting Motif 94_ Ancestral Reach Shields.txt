Crafting Motif 94: Ancestral Reach Shields

By Lieutenant Abrienna Nestoro, Imperial Legion

Reachman warriors are known far and wide for their ferocity in battle and the primitiveness of their arms and armor. Few Reachmen smelt iron, let alone steel, and at its best Reachman metalwork is poorly made. Instead, Reachman rely on materials provided by nature to fashion their weapons: wood, stone, hide, and bone. During Empress Hestra's recent campaign to establish Imperial rule in the Reach, we learned that a Reachman's hide shield can stop a hard-driven arrow just as well as steel-bossed birchwood, and an axe fashioned from the shoulderblade of a Druadach bear can part the links of light mail. Primitive, yesâ€”but effective as well.   

SHIELDS
Few trees in the Reach grow to the stature needed to produce stout, sawn planks, so Reachman shields are made from multiple layers of cured hide. Bristleback hide is favored, but elk hide is easier to come by and just as tough when glued together in sufficient layers. The best shields are made with sharpened bone spikes that allow for a deadly edge-bash, and look fierce as well.
