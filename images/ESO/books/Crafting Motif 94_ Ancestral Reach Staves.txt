Crafting Motif 94: Ancestral Reach Staves

By Lieutenant Abrienna Nestoro, Imperial Legion

Reachman warriors are known far and wide for their ferocity in battle and the primitiveness of their arms and armor. Few Reachmen smelt iron, let alone steel, and at its best Reachman metalwork is poorly made. Instead, Reachman rely on materials provided by nature to fashion their weapons: wood, stone, hide, and bone. During Empress Hestra's recent campaign to establish Imperial rule in the Reach, we learned that a Reachman's hide shield can stop a hard-driven arrow just as well as steel-bossed birchwood, and an axe fashioned from the shoulderblade of a Druadach bear can part the links of light mail. Primitive, yesâ€”but effective as well.   

STAVES
In the Reach, the staff is considered a witch's weapon. Most staves are fashioned from ash, hawthorn, or ironwood, and decorated with various charms and fetishes. Despite their simple appearances, Reachman staves produce highly destructive spells and evocations. There is nothing backwards about a Reach witch's magic.
