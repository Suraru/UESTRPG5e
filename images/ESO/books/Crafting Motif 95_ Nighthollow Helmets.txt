Crafting Motif 95: Nighthollow Helmets

By Lord Idrisin, Bearer of the Scarlet Insignia
A guide to crafting armor and weapons in the Nighthollow style

Dark, deadly, and elegant—these are the terms in which those few mortals who come to know our kind describe our arms and our bearing alike. One might be forgiven for presuming that the superb workmanship and exquisite proportions of the equipment we choose to employ in battle are the products of mere vanity, but I have found that these qualities are more than a matter of taste. The armor in which we dress for battle and the weapons we employ proclaim our identity and strike fear into the hearts of those foolish enough to stand against us. Yes, it suits the Nighthollow clan to remain in the shadows … most of the time. But when we step into the open, let our foes and thralls alike look upon us and know dread.

HELMETS
A full helm of dark, strong steel, the Nighthollow helmet features subtle swept-back hinges near the wearer's temples that are representative of bat ears or wolf ears—an homage to fellow predators of the darkness.
