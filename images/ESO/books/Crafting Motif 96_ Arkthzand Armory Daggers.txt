Crafting Motif 96: Arkthzand Armory Daggers

By Mathinn Palard, University of Gwylim

No other people have yet matched the alloys and techniques the Dwarves employed to fashion their weapons and armor. Alas, many of the Dwarven secrets of metal-working vanished from Tamriel centuries ago. Likewise, some artifacts of Arkthzand providence also feature magical crystals—perhaps the "aetherium" mentioned in various mythic histories—whose purpose and powers are understood by no other peoples. Yet with a careful study of the pieces intrepid adventurers have recovered from the depths of the Dwarven ruins sleeping beneath the Reach, we can draw valuable insights into the designs favored in the legendary realm of Arkthzand.

DAGGERS
Dwarves generally seemed to favor axes and maces to blades, but when they fashioned daggers and swords they did so with great skill. The blade itself is made from an alloy that bears a superficial resemblance to brass, yet it is harder and more durable than steel. To this day, no one knows what it is made from.
