Cult Screed

Thus spake the Master, and so do I pass on his word:

— Be cautious always. Extend the hand of the Master only in the shadows. 

— The abandoned mine is the perfect lair. (Well done, Athando.) Sacrifices to the Master should begin at once. Perhaps make use of these lava pools?

— The Master has been promised a mighty gift for working on Molag Bal's behalf. He has said we shall be given the gift as well. Prepare. Prepare for this day!
