10th First Seed
Met an interesting Orc. He'd been awkwardly looking away when I've seen him in the past few days. Orcs are usually so rough, but I noticed he carried a book, and asked him about it. After that, he forgot his shyness and we talked like old friends.

We shared a meal, and he told me his name. I'm not sure how to spell it, though.

He promised to bring me copies of their shaman's writings. Spinner Sandaerion will be pleased! I might give my new friend the glass blade I've been shaping.
