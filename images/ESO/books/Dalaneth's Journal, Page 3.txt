22nd Rain's Hand

Ulagush's been teaching me so much about the Orcs. I never knew his clan moves as much as mine does. We were discussing the differences between Mauloch and Y'ffre, when Yarnag (their shaman) came in. He said there's no comparing Mauloch to any of our gods, and slapped me. Ulagush hit him back, and that's when I found out Ulagush's mother is their clan chieftain.

Chief Ulukhaz is furious and has called for a meeting with my father. They won't understand any of this.
