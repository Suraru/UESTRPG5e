Daynila's Corpse-Kabob

A favorite of mine. Works for all Mer and Men, although Argonians can be tough and somewhat gamey. In general, avoid the tail.

Cut the most convenient and tender parts of the corpse—including eyeballs and internal organs—into gobbets. Skewer these on brochettes, interspersed with chunks of dried fish or snake, then cook over an open fire to desired doneness. Best served with red wine!
