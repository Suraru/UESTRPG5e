Destroyer's Rest

Herein lie beneath the soil, 
Destroyer's bones, no more to toil, 
Beneath the starry skies above, 
Or rend from us our hearthfelt love. 

For many years the bones brought fear, 
To little Elves, both far and near, 
But when Destroyer took its rest, 
A seed we laid within its breast. 

In time, we hope its roots grow deep, 
And 'neath the soil will come to keep, 
Destroyer's body here interred, 
For many years, 'til spoken word, 
Forgets his name and brings us peace,
As only time shall slay this beast.
