Dragonstar Arena Guest Book

Welcome to the greatest competition in all the planes of existence! Welcome to the Dragonstar Arena!

I am your host and battlemaster, the great and powerful Hiath. I know we're going to get along just fine, and I look forward to seeing you in action. Put on a good show and give it your best shot, and even if you die horribly, you will be remembered for at least being brave enough to step foot onto the Arena floor.

Now, please, sign in so that your name will be recorded in the Arena archieves. I never forget a face, but I'm terrible at remembering names.
