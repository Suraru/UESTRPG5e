Drovos Research Notes 3

My subjects have never been stronger, and there are still ways to prefect them. They shall be immune to every illness, live twice as long as their lesser kin. And my crowning achievement, the queen. Oh, yes, the queen I've developed will manifest all of the vitality of her colony and yield twice the eggs of any of her peers. No, she has no peers! This breed will be without equal in all of Vvardenfell, in all of Tamriel!

The mercenaries I've hired do not make for pleasant company, but they do grant me the security I need to ensure my research continues. I've already gotten rid of Devani, forcing her from the mines. She's taken to writing notes, turning my soldiers into carriers. I believe I will grant her request and allow her one last conversation.
