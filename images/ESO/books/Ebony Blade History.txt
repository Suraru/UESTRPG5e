Ebony Blade History

To anyone reading this: BEWARE THIS BLADE

It has corrupted and perverted the desires of great men and women. Yet its power is without equal: to kill while your victim smiles at you. Only a Daedra most foul could have concocted such a malevolent and twisted weapon. It appears that all who wield it end up with the crazed eyes of those wild men who roam the hills chattering with rabbits.

It is not to be trifled with. Not even the hottest fires of the Skyforge could melt it; indeed, the coals themselves seemed to cool when it was placed within. We cannot destroy it, and we would not have it fall into the hands of our enemies. So we keep it hidden, never to be used.

Woe be to any who choose to take it.
