Enough Kitten Play!

P'ruuti,

This one begs you leave the sliding stones where they are. He knows you are bored on watch, but the great cubes are our only means of opening the gates. Many of your blood-kin cannot pass through the gates as you do, and neither can our supplies.

The stones might very well be part of some greater puzzle, but we have no need to concern ourselves with the secrets of long dead cats, only filling our cups and tasting life as Sangiin desires. Most of this temple is in ruins, do not trouble yourself with broken toys. More importantly, do not trouble the rest of us.
