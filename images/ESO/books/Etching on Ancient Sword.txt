Etching on Ancient Sword

Nine years in bliss, our fates were tied. Our lovers' kiss? Not one denied.

If we had dreamed, our hearts awoke when on the tenth a battle broke.

I went to war, against our fears. Far out of sight for many years.

I've returned, my love, so we might break our bonds and be set free!
