Everfull Flagon Journal, Page 2

An interesting fellow stopped by today. A mage of some sort, I think. Sat in a corner, kept his hood drawn over his features. At first, he was grim and kept to himself. After a mead, however, he asked about the village and my tavern. I confess, it felt good to unburden myself. The fellow listened sympathetically and indicated there might be a way to improve my situation. 

He said he might know how to turn things around. To get customers in the door and make them stay for a while. He said he would return after he thought about the problem and consulted his books.

I can't wait to hear what he comes up with. I'd give anything to make this tavern successful.
