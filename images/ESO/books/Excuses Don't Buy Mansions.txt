Excuses Don't Buy Mansions

B—

You know I respect you. You know the headman respects you. So you must imagine how much we feel disrespected by your absolute lack of product out of Haven.

Pirates, a Daedric Prince … none of this matters. Excuses don't buy mansions. Our product does.

None of that "you only get one warning, or else" drivel. We respect you too much for anything but the cold, hard truth:

Find a way to deliver what you promised, or you're dead.

Respectfully,
