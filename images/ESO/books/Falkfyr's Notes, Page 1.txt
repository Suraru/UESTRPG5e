Falkfyr's Notes, Page 1

Day 3: I am Falkfyr Snowmason, vassal of King Hylfrald of Solitude. This may well be my final report, but I will not fail my king!

My mission was to track a band of Reachmen marauders troubling our borders. The Reachmen fled west past Karthwasten, then turned north. I followed them into the mountains, but was thwarted by a blizzard. When I tried to take shelter in a cave, the ground collapsed beneath me.

I have waited two days for rescue, and now my provisions are running low. While I have found a door in this massive cavern, I cannot open it. My compass still works, so I will head west and scout for high ground. Maybe I'll be able to spot another way out.

I leave this report here in case I fail to find my way out. If you find it, know that Falkfyr Snowmason did not abandon his duty!
