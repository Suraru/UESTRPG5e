Falkfyr's Notes, Page 2

Day 4: This cavern seems endless. Worse, it is infested with giant bugs! Grandpa Isrig used to tell me tales of giant bugs in the Morthal swamps when I was growing up, but I never believed him. Now l know where the bugs come from.

My food is gone, but most importantly, I'm out of water. A week's supplies for a four-day scouting mission aren't enough after you fall down a hole. I can see an underground stream from here, though. I have no choice but to sneak past all the giant bugs if I want to refill my canteen.

If I succeed, I'll leave another note by the stream. If I fail, know Falkfyr Snowmason died fighting with an axe in each hand!
