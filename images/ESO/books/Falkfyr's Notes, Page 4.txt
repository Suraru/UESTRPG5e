Falkfyr's Notes, Page 4

Day 6: Those damned Dwarves left their city locked up tight. I have no way in and nothing to pick their locks. If there's food inside, it's not for me.

This morning I ate one of the grayish-white mushrooms. It tasted like undercooked meat. I'll rest today and see if it kills me. If it doesn't, I'll have all the food I need!

Day 7: The mushrooms aren't poisonâ€”I can forage for everything I need. I'm going to live! My tale of survival in the depths of Blackreach will become the stuff of legends!

I can see a grove of tree-like fungus across the river to the south. I'll try that way next.
