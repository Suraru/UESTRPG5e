Falkfyr's Notes, Page 7

Day ? Doesn't matter.

The air sings of purple and blood waters the stone. The spores of the Great Oom take root. It will not be long now.

I eat of the dirt and drink of the dark. I am home now. We are home. 

The shell crumbles but the skitters take no notice. It is inside, and it is ready.

Speak, Great Oom! Speak of the Rootmason! Speak to me once more of the buried dream!

It is time for me to grow.
