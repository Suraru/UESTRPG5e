Famia Mercius's Journal, Part 2

So much has happened since my last journal entry! As I scribble down these words, Kassandra's riverboat ferries me, Xukas, Jaxsik-Orrn, Kassandra, and Whiptail to the Ree-An-Wo, or "Swallowed Grove"! Mara's heart, I'm getting ahead of myself again.

Once again, Cyrodilic Collections' newest member proved instrumental. Acting in concert with Xukas and Jaxsik-Orrn, they discovered that essential information about the Remnant of Argon was tucked away in ancient relics belonging to the Bright-Throat and Dead-Water tribes. Each tribal relic provided one half of a riddleâ€”a riddle I managed to solve! From what I can tell, we must travel to the Swallowed Grove and conduct something called a "dream-wallow" ritual. I have no idea what this ritual will teach us. I can only hope that it directs us to the Remnant itself. We'll learn soon enough, I guess. I can hardly wait!
