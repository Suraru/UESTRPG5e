Fjar's Interrogation Transcript

Agent: How are you? Are you being treated well?

Fjar: So far. I know you guys aren't all the monsters you're made out to be.

Agent: That's good to hear. You're married to a Breton, aren't you? Helewise?

Fjar: Yes, sir. Happily married eight years.  

Agent: Good. Good. It's like I keep telling my men, family is more important than anything else, even the king.

Fjar: I couldn't agree more.
