Flesh to Cut from Bone

(A Pirate Song)

If you see it glitters bright
Then take it for your own,
Pile the corpses to a height
To make a pirate throne!

For what's made weak is ours to break
And what's ill-guarded ours to take
Just flesh to cut from bone,
More flesh to cut from bone.

If they try to lock the gates
We'll burn the whole damned town
They'll bring their guards and magistrates
And then we'll cut them down.

For what's made weak is ours to break
And what's ill-guarded ours to take
Just flesh to cut from bone,
More flesh to cut from bone.

They'll bring their soldiers by the score
To drive us from their lands
But we will have a hundred more
In our brave pirate band!

For what's made weak is ours to break
And what's ill-guarded ours to take
Just flesh to cut from bone,
More flesh to cut from bone.

And if they cry for mercy, then
We'll answer them with steel
For pity's made for other men
We'll grind beneath our heel.

For what's made weak is ours to break
And what's ill-guarded ours to take
Just flesh to cut from bone,
More flesh to cut from bone.
