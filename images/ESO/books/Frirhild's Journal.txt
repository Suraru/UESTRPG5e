Frirhild's Journal

Eislef suspects but doesn't know.
No telling what he'd do.
Rae found my pipe but didn't know. Told her it was one of Eislef's.

Running low, might try moon-sugar if I run out.

Every time Eislef sees that Elf he yells at Rae.
Not her fault. Can't help herself.
I can't help her either.

Saw the Dunmer again. Eislef didn't.
Had to warn him, make him go away.
No good can come of this, not the way Eislef feels.
