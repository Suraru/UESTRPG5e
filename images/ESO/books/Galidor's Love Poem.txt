Galidor's Love Poem

Oh dearest Javana,
You know that I wanna,
Spend THREE lifetimes with you.

But my pockets are bare,
I've got nothing to spare,
No MONEY, and holes in my shoes.

But one day, you know,
Away we will go,
To oak forests, deep and green.

We'll rest in the roots,
And eat grahtberry fruits,
Just like a king and his queen.
