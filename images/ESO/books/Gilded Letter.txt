Gilded Letter

Norion,

Our scheme has encountered an unfortunate obstacle. The majority of the people you sent have been slaughtered by a maddeningly altruistic <<1>>. I fear I may be unmasked as an agent of the Veiled Heritance if I don't leave Silsailen immediately. I'll pack a few necessities and meet you in Tanzelwil. Keep your head down.
