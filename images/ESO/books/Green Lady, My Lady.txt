Green Lady, My Lady

Wake, my lady, your day has come
We'll dress you in silk
Weave feathers in your hair
And tie leather slippers on your feet

Come, my lady, your love awaits
On this day, we'll encircle
A banquet table now filled
With tonight's succulent feast

Green Lady, my lady, come down
Your guests now are gathered
And bright, cheerful music plays
How blessed are Y'ffre's children!
