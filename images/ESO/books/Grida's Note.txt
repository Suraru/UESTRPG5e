Grida's Note

Hey, Dralof!

If you're reading this, I guess you got tired of waiting and came to find me. The apothecary was empty when I arrived. I don't know what happened here, but it must have been your kind of party. Well, I not only missed the party, but I couldn't find any bath salts. I did find the apothecary's recipe, though. It requires:

— Four Mudcrab Claws
— Two Globs of Troll Fat
— Daril

(It says Daril is an Argonian ingredient provided by the nearby Argonian camp. Someone named Laughs-at-Danger sells the stuff.)

Grind the ingredients at a mill. Hey, there's one up the hill!

Since everyone else is gone, I'm going to try to whip up a batch of the bath salts myself. How hard could it be? If you really can't wait, come find me and help out, you lazy skeever!
