Hadaz's Final Letter

Merrunz maniacs and Daedra are everywhere. Have to make this quick.

The cultists—the Claws of Daegon—found some kind of magic tool. They call it the Deadland Hammer. They take oil and sulfur from the mine and pound it into some kind of summoning stone. But it doesn't call out more daedroths or banekin. It summons iron atronachs! Metal giants with hearts made of coal and lava! If you find this, please tell the Mane. And if you can, put an end to this.

Oh, and tell Mara'dahni, I'm sorry.

Hadaz
