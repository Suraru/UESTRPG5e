Harrani's Report

Incident 1: 
The apothecary was acting suspicious. Wouldn't look me in the eye. Probably sold ointment for the pox to my cousin again. Did not pursue.

Incident 2:
<<1>> heard strange noises in the warehouse next to the armorer's shop. Investigated, but found no sign of anything missing. Did not pursue.

Incident 3:
That Maormer captain threw a beggar off the Serpent's Kiss. Said she caught him poking around belowdecks. Her ship, her rules. Did not pursue.
