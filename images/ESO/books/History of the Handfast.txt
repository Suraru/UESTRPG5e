History of the Handfast

Tooth and claw
Blood enflamed
Chaos rules
A race defamed.

Stories lost
In history foul
Generations lost
In a werewolf's howl.

But a god's compassion
And a hero's soul
Fought twisting form
Upon ancient soil.

The cause seemed lost
In hope so lean
Until woman enter'd
Clad all in Green.

Hero and Lady
And god alone
Fought with muscle
Blood and bone.

The race so saved
From bestial ire
Oathbreakers sent
To sleep in mire

Hero and Lady
Will forever last
Joined together
By great handfast.
