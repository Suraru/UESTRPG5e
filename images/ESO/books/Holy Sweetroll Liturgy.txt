Holy Sweetroll Liturgy

All hail the Holy Sweetroll!
Fluffy, gooey, warm, and sweet
All hail the Holy Sweetroll!
All hail this delicious treat!

All hail the Holy Sweetroll!
Drizzled with its blessed glaze
All hail the Holy Sweetroll!
Our mouths too full to call out praise!

All hail the Holy Sweetroll!
Nestled in its ebony crate
All hail the Holy Sweetroll!
Served upon its divine plate.

All hail the Holy Sweetroll!
Fluffy, gooey, warm, and sweet
All hail the Holy Sweetroll!
All hail this delicious treat!
