Honor's Rest Monument Stone

In these halls the warriors find serenity,
Upon walls names carved for eternity,
And shall never be forgotten.

Ash and boneâ€”here shall they rest,
By iron and stone does honor attest,
It must never be forgotten.

Within is treasure greater than jewels,
Through the gift of the Memorial Pools,
They shall never be forgotten.

Drink deep of long lost memories,
Shed light on faded histories,
That must never be forgotten.
