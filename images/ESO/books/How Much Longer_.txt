How Much Longer?

I've been looking out the window and watching the time go by, waiting to see when this nonsense is going to be over. It all seems a bit much. I've been through my share of occupations, but this is getting ridiculous. How much longer will this go on?

Luckily, I don't own anything they can actually use. I used to curse Zenithar for my poor luck with gold. Now I think I'll take a pilgrimage to one of his shrines and thank him. Who's to say this wasn't his plan for me all along?
