I Know Its Name

I know its name!

I have seen signs of a spectral abomination lurking in these caves.

I have survived long enough to know it is not a creature of flesh. 

It is bone, yet it feeds on blood.

I dare not return to the surface before I know the truth.

I dare not speak above a whisper, lest it hear me.

My footfalls would summon it. 

Running would summon it.

Screaming would summon it.

Sleeping would make me a victim.

I am not going back until I know the truth â€¦ or until it feasts on my blood.

It will not! I will prevail!

I will stay awake.

I must not sleep.

I know its name, and I will destroy it.
