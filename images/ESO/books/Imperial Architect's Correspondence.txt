Imperial Architect's Correspondence

Honored members of the Elder Council,

It is with great pride that I report we have finally found the city's legendary Centrata! As you know, the city's underground is a complex nest of sewer drains and crumbling Ayleid ruins. We've always assumed that there was a grand design in their construction, but lacked the requisite resources to prove it. Now, with help from Chancellor Tharn and the wise Mannimarco, we've been able to delve deeper than we ever thought possible.

Our survey indicates that all channels and passages eventually lead to the Centrata, a massive underground chamber that houses the White-Gold Tower's foundation. I can tell you, it is quite a sight to behold. The Tower rests on a stone monopile, supported by six massive vaults. The significance of this discovery cannot be overstated. It confirms countless architectural theories about the six districts' connections to the Tower and the age of the city's infrastructure. It might also grant us valuable insights into the nature of the White-Gold Tower and its power over Nirn.

I would like to conduct a more thorough investigation, but our esteemed benefactor Mannimarco has declared the area off-limits. I do not mean to sound ungrateful. Without his help we never would have found the Centrata. But we still have a great deal to learn about how the chamber was constructed. I hope that the Elder Council might intercede on our behalf.

Best regards, 

Mycaelis Julus, Imperial Architect, Council for Civic Planning
