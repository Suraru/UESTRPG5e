Ithguleoir

We all remember Annine Praul,
Went out to sea one day;
Ithguleoir bit off her head,
Beneath the sea of gra-ay, beneath the sea of gray!

And what about Therese's son,
A brave and handsome boy;
Ithguleoir has et him up,
His mother's pride and jo-oy, his mother's pride and joy!

Oh how we mourn our goodman Thom, 
Who swore he'd catch the beast;
Ithguleoir et him whole, 
And then he ate the pri-iest, and then he ate the priest!
