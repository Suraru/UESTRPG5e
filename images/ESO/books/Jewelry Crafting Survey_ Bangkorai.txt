Jewelry Crafting Survey: Bangkorai

Resource cache uncovered: South of Yanurah's Respite, between the Qharroa Ruins and Damar Farmstead.

If I could think a single thought to burn every wasp out of the air, I would. Otherwise, lower Bangkorai is quite nice. Between the fascinating ruins and broadly striated natural stone formations, there's much to take in and all beautiful.

Upper Bangkorai, on the other hand, is not. It's all old damp forest out-crowding the delightful natural stone. I suppose the river's nice. I'm reasonably sure I heard a werewolf cry at some point during the night. So I suppose it's either werewolves or wasps, and you have to choose.
