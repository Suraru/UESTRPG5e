Jewelry Crafting Survey: Craglorn III

Resource cache uncovered: On a rocky cliff overlooking a lake island, west of the Seeker's Archive, south of Anka-Ra's Avowal, with an only slightly occluded view of a local waterfall.

I spied a group of adventurers engaging in some amount of adventure recently. Without my guide, surveying the region's been quite peaceful, so this was a bit of a shock.

Anyway - as is my particular habit, naturally - I avoided them entirely. As I crept away, there were a number of explosions, some screaming monsters, and a lot of shouting. Bothersome, to be sure. I wish adventurers would stop in their adventures periodically to consider how much they disrupt peoples' lives.
