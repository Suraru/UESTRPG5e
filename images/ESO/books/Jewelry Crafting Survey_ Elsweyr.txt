Jewelry Crafting Survey: Elsweyr

Resource cache uncovered: Northeast of the Tenmar wayshrine, pass through a stone archway leading behind a massive lith, against the southeastern plateau. Be ready for a hike.

Why do I always find myself in an active warzone? I was led to believe Elsweyr would be like a vacation - I'd be able to enjoy the warm sun, the diverse geography, the interesting plantlife, and the acrobatic locals during this trip.

Alas! Dragons are REAL and DETERMINED TO RUIN MY FUN. I may never stop screaming. Never!
