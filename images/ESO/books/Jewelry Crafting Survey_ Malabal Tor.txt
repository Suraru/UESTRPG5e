Jewelry Crafting Survey: Malabal Tor

Resource cache uncovered: In an unmarked prospector's cavern, between the Tomb of the Apostates and Bone Grappler's Nest, southwest of Tanglehaven.

Imagine my surprise at discovering an actual, proper lode! Granted, it features the dusty bones of a long-dead prospector, and a very intimate family of hoarvors, but it remains a pleasant surprise all the same.

Yet, it remains a gem buried in the rank, foetid heart of Valenwood. Alas.
