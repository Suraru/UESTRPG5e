Jewelry Crafting Survey: Rivenspire

Resource cache uncovered: On the western shore of an oddly sonorous island northwest of Northsalt Village and Northpoint, in a natural recess visible from Westwind Lighthouse.

This island is blessedly free of mudcrabs. With the suspicious volume of shipwrecks nearby, there's ample resources to (perhaps) build a modest cottage here, though I find the curious singing sound the wind makes unnerving.
I'm frankly not sure why some enterprising hermit hasn't thrown a home together here yet. It's a nice place â€” you're close enough to the shore to be able to fling stones at crabs from the island, and far enough to where you can really drink in the scenery.

It's also a bit cozy! I really don't feel like I'm alone.
