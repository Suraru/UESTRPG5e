Jewelry Crafting Survey: The Rift

Resource cache uncovered: Nestled into the cliffs, northeast of Riften, opposite a camp of giants, north of the Lost Prospect.

Perhaps it has something to do with all of the mammoth cheese aging up the butte from me as I write this, but this area of Riften is rank with sulfur and urea. I just thought you might like to know.

That aside, The Rift is certainly one of the more hospitable regions of Skyrim. Climate-wise, that is. Beautiful countryside, though a bit cold for my tastes. And ripe.
