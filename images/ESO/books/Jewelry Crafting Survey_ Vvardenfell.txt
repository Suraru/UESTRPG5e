Jewelry Crafting Survey: Vvardenfell

Resource cache uncovered: On a damp island southwest of Gnisis or, more specifically, its wayshrine.

My best decision in coming to Vvardenfell was in trading for a good ash mask from some clever Zainab Ashlander. I can see just fine and — more importantly — am coughing far less often.

More importantly, I'm very much looking forward to being done with everything and heading back to Suran. I shan't say why, but would recommend a visit to nearly anyone.
