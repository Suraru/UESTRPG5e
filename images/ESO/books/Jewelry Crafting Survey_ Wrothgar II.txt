Jewelry Crafting Survey: Wrothgar II

Resource cache uncovered: Between the Exile's Barrow and Accursed Nursery, due south of the Morkul Plain Wayshrine, at the foot of a great butte.

Came up with a system of shorthand to make recording my notes easier. Inconveniently, descending from the mountains made Wrothgar incredibly more bearable. 

It's still cold, but my breath doesn't freeze onto my nose immediately, and I can write more ably. So, I suppose I have shorthand for any such time I find myself short of time or in another frozen wasteland. Great.
