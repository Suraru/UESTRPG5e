Journal of Priestess Aranwen

At the Queen's behest, I have agreed to perform an important part of the ritual honoring the Ancestral Spirits. Since many of the ancestors have grown hostile, I plan to do this in a quiet grove where I often meditate. The area is usually only occupied by a lone spirit named Colanwe. While mischievous and enigmatic, Colanwe knows me and has always tolerated my presence in the past. I feel certain it will be a safe place to perform the ritual ceremony.

Yours in Xarxes, 

Priestess Aranwen
