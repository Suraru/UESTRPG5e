Khunzar-ri and the Demon: Part One

An ancient Khajiiti myth as recorded by Moon-Singer Azargo Long-Tale

In the time before time, when the sixteen kingdoms were barely more than sixteen tribes, the great hero Khunzar-ri went on many adventures. After Khunzar-ri defeated the giant Drol by consuming four-hundred-and-one moon-sugar pies, he met a demon.

The demon said, "My brothers and I shall take this land and its treasures. Even the moons from the sky!" Khunzar-ri objected, but the demon laughed. "You cannot stop us, little cat-thing!"

Khunzar-ri said, "Not by myself, foul demon. I shall gather a Kra'Jun—a company of heroes—starting with the Altmer, Nurarion the Perfect, who communes among the buried roots of the Ayleid worms."

These are the words and the words are true.
