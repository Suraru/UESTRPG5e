Raynor's magic device works pretty well. I'm practically invisible to Dwarven constructs. It does flicker every three and a half minutes, though. I've got to make sure nothing's nearby when I finish counting to two hundred and ten.

I had a few close calls before I determined the time between each misfire, but since I figured that out I haven't had any problems.

Raynor got the idea for this device while studying the light crystals at Bthanual. Amazingâ€”one of his devices actually serves a useful purpose!
