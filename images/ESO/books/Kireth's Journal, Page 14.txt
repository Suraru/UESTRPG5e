Kireth's Journal, Page 14

A lot of Mzulft is pristine. It's abandoned, like all of the Dwemer ruins we've explored. And it's empty, except for the constructs. But everything still works. It's eerie to see glowing lights on the wall and hear the pipes steaming. It's like the place is waiting for someone, like the occupants just stepped out and will return at any moment.

I wish I could just explore these ruins. Every ruin tells another story, and if I don't get to crawl into every corner, that story is just half-told. Raynor would laugh if he heard me say that. You'd better not read this, brother!
