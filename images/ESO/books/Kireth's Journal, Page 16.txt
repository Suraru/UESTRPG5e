Kireth's Journal, Page 16

Someone else has been in here, and I'm not talking about the ancient Dwarves! I found a bridge, obviously not of Dwemer origin, and I see numerous signs that other explorers recently visited this ruin.

I wonder what they found? They better not have taken all the best stuff!

Wait a moment. What if they weren't as fast and clever as me? What if a trap or a construct got them?

I really don't want to come across their horribly mutilated bodies. That would be gross.
