Kireth's Journal, Page 19

Curse the luck! Stupid, cheap journal binding! Some of my best entries have fallen out! Oh, well.

This whole place rumbles every so often. As I get deeper into the ruins, Mzulft feels more and more unstable. It's like the entire structure is about to collapse or something. That would be bad.

I came across spots where the walls and ceiling have fallen in, letting in snow and sunshine. And I feel a cold breeze blowing from deeper in. I hope the passage I'm looking for isn't buried.

Damn! The wind took another page!
