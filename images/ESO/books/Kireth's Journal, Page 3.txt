Kireth's Journal, Page 3

Raynor and I are actually getting paid for this delve! That's a step up, as far as I'm concerned.

After Bthanual, who needs the Academy? We're ready for the big time! Bring on the Mages Guild!

But we really need to find something good to impress the Guild. Sometimes it feels like they're just humoring us.

Raynor thinks that with the backing of the King of Skyrim, though, we have a better chance to get in. I hope he's right.
