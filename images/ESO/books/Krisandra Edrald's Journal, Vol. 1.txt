Krisandra Edrald's Journal, Vol. 1

My daughter has become quite maudlin since Federic left for <<1>>. I have assured her that all will be right when he returns, but she remains quite dour.

I have taken the liberty of sending to Fell's Run for a cask of tawny port. Such is hard to come by with the growing trouble in the region, and spirits from the arbors of Summerset are always a welcome reprieve from our local distillations. Surely, their bright and sunny notes will bring her aught but cheer!

Arlie came to me this evening in tears. It would seem <<2>>, simpleton that she is, has managed to cause her no end of distress. While I can understand how it might be difficult for her to fathom that she does harm with her attentions, that is no excuse.

If only Federic were here. His constant company has always comforted our dearest daughter. What I wouldn't give for him to return on the morrow.

No matter how strongly I word my arguments, Allan seems unconcerned. He's rather attached to that servant girl. Doesn't he see what's at stake here?

If <<2>> is allowed to interfere with our daughter's wedding, it could ruin us all! Such self-indulgence is abominable! I'll not allow her to continue this harassment.
