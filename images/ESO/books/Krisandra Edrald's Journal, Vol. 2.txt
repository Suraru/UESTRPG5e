Krisandra Edrald's Journal, Vol. 2

Allan continues to believe this association between our daughter and <<1>> is but a passing fancy, that we should allow it to play out. He hasn't had to look into her eyes and see the terrible divide it has created within her.

She is torn with herself, and I will not watch her rent asunder while we stand helplessly by. If he will not do anything about it, I shall take matters into my own hands!

Went to talk with the Constable today only to find her in her cups. It would seem our estate is not alone in its troublesâ€”there has been a power shift in <<2>>.

Her replacement was not helpful nor was he forthcoming as to why. It would seem the town will no longer bother itself with our affairs nor ensure our protection! The nerve of the man. When this business with <<1>> is settled, I will have strong words for his superiors in <<3>>!

Opened the Undercroft for the first time in ages. When we locked it up after Allan's mother died, I had hoped we would never open it again, but it is my only hope now.

I've found it! A ragged old book detailing what is necessary to contact Mehrunes Dagon, Daedric Prince of change! If any can alter our fate, it will be him. The ritual seems simple enough, though I know dabbling with even the simplest of conjurations can prove dangerous. Still, what choice do I have?

I've dispatched a courier to <<3>> for the necessary components. We will have to be discreet about it, but I trust Alison to be discreet.
