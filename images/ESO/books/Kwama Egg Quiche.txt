Kwama Egg Quiche

Ingredients:
- One medium kwama egg or two small kwama eggs
- Ground meal
- Mug of water
- Diced tomato
- Garlic
- Salt (to taste)

To Prepare:

Break eggs in a large bowl. Add tomato, garlic, and salt. Whisk briskly. 

Combine the meal and water to make a dough. 

Layer half of the dough in a deep pot. Pour half the egg mixture over the dough. Place another layer of dough, pour remaining egg mixture into pot and finish with another layer of dough.

Cover pot tightly and hang over a small fire, or place the covered pot within a hot oven. 

Check the quiche after one hour. Once a brown crust forms on the top, the casserole is ready to eat.
