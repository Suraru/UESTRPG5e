Lady in the Cistern: Silver-Claw's Theory

I do not know who the lady in the cistern used to be. But truly, it no longer matters who the statue was.

You see, I believe the statue now represents Zeira. Without her guidance, this strange little family of which I now proudly call myself a part would no longer exist. So for me, the Lady in the Cistern is your guildmaster.
