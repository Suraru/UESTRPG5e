Lady in the Cistern: Thrag's Theory

The lady in the cistern is clearly Nocturnal. Take a look at the statue—the face somewhat obscured, cloaked in an all-concealing robe, and hidden in a cistern that was once bricked off behind another cistern. Who hides water? Nocturnal cultists, that's who.

Not that I was ever in a Nocturnal cult.
