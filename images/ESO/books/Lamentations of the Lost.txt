Lamentations of the Lost

by Anonymous

They said explore Nirn.
To many lands I traveled.
Never feeling like home.

I worked for a merchant,
Sweeping dusty shops for coin.
No respect or wealth.

I joined a brigade.
We saw the horrors of war,
Blood-dripped battlefields.

To an arrow I fell.
For greed I died all alone.
Buried by strangers.
