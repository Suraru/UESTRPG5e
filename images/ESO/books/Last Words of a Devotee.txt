Last Words of a Devotee

I won't live to write again. The Dagonites have broken into the inner sanctum. Our escape has been cut off.

They will burn the flesh from my bones, but I am at peace. My thoughts go to Hermaeus Mora. They willl be recorded in the eternal libraries.

I go to join the Golden Eye in Apocrypha.
