Letter from Rakhad

<<1>>,

It has come to our attention that you and your sister have inherited your uncle's old house.

Considering your substantial debt to us, it is surprising to us that you are now sitting in the lap of luxury.

Perhaps you should make sure your sister has no interest in keeping that house. Otherwise, I'll have to convince her myself. You and your uncle know how convincing I can be.
