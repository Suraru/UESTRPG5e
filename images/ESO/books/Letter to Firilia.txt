Letter to Firilia

Firilia,

It's been ages. I've failed. I know it. Even now, I write this and know your eyes will never see it. 

I got the medicine. As promised. The one thing I ever managed to do successfully for this family. And I return only to find that Falinesti is no longer here.

Would you believe me if you read this? Do you think I'm a failure even now? Did our daughter survive the illness? She wouldn't know me. Even then. I was never there for either of you. Why is it I'm not allowed to make amends? I want to make it right. I was going to make it right.
