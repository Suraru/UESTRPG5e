Letter to Mairrna

Mairrna,

Blood and briar! Where is everyone? Grarischan, Enngotain, Manechta â€¦ I was eating with them last week and now I can't find any of them. Either we've had a lot of deserters in the last few days or something's terribly wrong.

There are less and less people in here and more and more birds. Weird birds, too. You don't think the birds are eating the people, do you? Let's talk later. I have to go see Warlord Uchuiran now. Maybe he'll explain all these things.
