Letter to Rana

Captain Rana,

In light of your actions, I have no choice but to strip you of your command and rank. Your time at the Pelagiad Garrison is over.

Tomorrow you will appear before a court-martial. They will decide your ultimate fate.

May the Three have mercy on your writhing soul. The court will not.

â€” General Vayne Redoran, Vivec Garrison
