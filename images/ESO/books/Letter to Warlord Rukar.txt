Letter to Warlord Rukar

Rukar

I don't care what deal the coven witches made with our leaders. I'm heading back to the Reach. Secret meetings, vampires. I'm no coward, but there are too many things going on that I don't understand. I want to take back our land and destroy these Nords as much as the next Reachman, but this level of magic is too much for even an old shaman like me. 

If you know what's good for you, you'll do the same before this enterprise kills you.
