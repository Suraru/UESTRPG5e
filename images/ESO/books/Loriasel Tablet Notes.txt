Loriasel Tablet Notes

Entry 1
Progress! The tablet was worth the journey to <<1>>. Like many of their relics, the Ayleids masked the tablet's secrets with illusory wards and destructive traps to make the slightest divination an exercise in mortal danger.

Less a concern for myself, of course. The true transcription reads as follows:

"Epevoy an anyadena av <<2>>e pado an sunnand.
Can an canomora racuvarima.
Arctane va ceye av <<2>>e.
Malatu ye nemalatuis shauta ry relle asva relleis."

Entry 2
My translation of the <<1>> tablet is woefully inelegant, but I believe it says the following:

"Speak the life-treaty of <<2>> before the blessed-stone.
Call the Daedric herald who was cast down.
Accept the shadow of <<2>>.
Truth and not-truth come as water within many-waters."

The word '<<2>>' appears twice in the script. I find no reference to this word in any of my books regarding the Ayleid language. It seems to be a name, but of what?

[Entry 3 is missing.]

Entry 4
<<2>> is amicable enough, if cryptic. It was hours before she seemed to comprehend any language but old Ayleid and Daedric pidgin.

When she finally spoke, she did so with eloquence and a surprisingly cheerful curiosity. According to <<2>>, she once served <<3>>. She claims the seal upon <<4>> was placed by Azura herself.

While I'm apprehensive about trusting any Daedra, Winged Twilights such as <<2>> are known to be servants of Azura. Beyond this, the shrine outside <<4>> is proof enough of this location's importance to the Daedric Prince of Dawn and Dusk.

After years of searching, could I finally be within reach of reversing <<3>>'s terrible fate?
