Loriasel Tablet, Entry 2

Entry 2
My translation of the <<1>> tablet is woefully inelegant, but I believe it says the following:

"Speak the life-treaty of <<2>> before the blessed-stone.
Call the Daedric herald who was cast down.
Accept the shadow of <<2>>.
Truth and not-truth come as water within many-waters."

The word "<<2>>" appears twice in the script. I find no reference to this word in any of my books regarding the Ayleid language. It seems to be a name, but of what?
