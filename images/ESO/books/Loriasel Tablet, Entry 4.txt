Loriasel Tablet, Entry 4

Entry 4
<<1>> is amicable enough, if cryptic. It was hours before she seemed to comprehend any language but old Ayleid and Daedric pidgin.

When she finally spoke, she did so with eloquence and a surprisingly cheerful curiosity. According to <<1>>, she once served <<2>>. She claims the seal upon <<3>> was placed by Azura herself.

While I'm apprehensive about trusting any Daedra, Winged Twilights such as <<1>> are known to be servants of Azura. Beyond this, the shrine outside <<3>> is proof enough of this location's importance to the Daedric Prince of Dawn and Dusk.

After years of searching, could I finally be within reach of reversing <<2>>'s terrible fate?
