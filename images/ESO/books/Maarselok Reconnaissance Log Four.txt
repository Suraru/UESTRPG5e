Maarselok Reconnaissance Log Four

Y'ffre, help us! It'd all been quiet! Creatures came spilling out of this blue rot once the main force made camp. Like they were waiting for us! We're surrounded. Trapped in this fetid cesspit. They don't attack unless we try to leave.

* * *
I can't see anyone else. I can't see them. I'm the only one who got away. I'm the only one. The only one.

I can still here them screaming. The blue got in them and made them sick. made them mad. They attacked us! We all ran. All ran. It's just me now. I need to get home. The Green will protect me. Protect me from the blue. 

PROTECT ME PLEASE!
