Maarselok Reconnaissance Log One

Passage over the Tenmar border was uneventful. Khajiit haven't been seen this far west in ages. No signs of the Dragon, though the wildlife seems on edge, like a bad storm is coming. Captain wants us well ahead of the main force.

Haven't been out this way before. A bit balmy for my taste, but this valley is as lush as the Green. Wonder why the Khajiit never resettled it? Or left in the first place? 

There are enough ruins to suggest there used to be a lot of Khajiit out here. Though a Senche-Lion did try to make a meal out of me. Usually they at least try to be stealthy. Eh, cats do as they do. 

Still no sign of the Dragon, which is all the Captain cares about.
