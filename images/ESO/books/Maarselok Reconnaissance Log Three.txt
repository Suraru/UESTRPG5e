Maarselok Reconnaissance Log Three

We spotted him! The Dragon finally left its roost. It looked like he was searching for something. Think I held my breath out of fear he caught wind of our attack force, but he eventually landed up near the summit and settled in. Now we know where the big blue bastard lives.

I never heard of Dragons making nests, but I think this one might be part magpie. Or skeever. The mountain up by the summit has gone blue as he is. Glows bright as can be at night. It'll be our guiding star as we advance up the mountain in the middle of the night.
