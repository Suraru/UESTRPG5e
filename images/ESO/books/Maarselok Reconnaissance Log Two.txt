Maarselok Reconnaissance Log Two

Seems like these ruins haven't been completely abandoned. There are boot tracks around. Some fresh, some not, but it tells me folk have been squatting here or at least passing through within the last few months at least.

I think there's been a mage camping out here. Quite a few sorcery bits and bobs left lying around. Thought hermit wizards only existed in story books. Probably took off once the Dragon showed up. These caves will make a decent base camp for the main force, though.
