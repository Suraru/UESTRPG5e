Matthild Built This Place

At sixty winters she left Skyrim for good
She found this place and made it her home

At sixty-one summers she built this place
She took only from the ground to make it
As is the custom in Valenwood

At sixty-two summers she met the Silvenar
She offered to teach the ways of her people
For she knew much of making things

At sixty-two winters she taught his people
She learned as much as she taught
And was loved by all her students
 
At eighty winters she went to Sovngarde
She left this place to all who would teach
And to all who would learn
