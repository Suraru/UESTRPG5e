Mead, Mead, Mead!

(A Drinking Song)

Mead, mead, mead!
Wonderfully wet, sinfully sweet!
Heft your mead horns and hold your mugs high,
We want to keep drinking until we do die!

Mead, mead, mead!
It's what a body needs!
It makes us strong and wise and brave,
There's nothing better, it's what we crave!

Mead, mead, mead!
I drink it morning, noon, and eve.
I like it spiced and sweet and powerful,
I'll soon be drunk and that's quite probable,
Mead, mead, mead!
