Message in a Bottle

To whoever finds this note:

The ship is lost. At first, I thought we had run afoul of some Maormer raiders. The truth is much worse.

Chitinous creatures from the depths clawed up the keel, mounting the gunwales. Nightmares from the sea are taking the ship. They are led by a Sea Sload. Z'Maja, I heard her say. They will come for Summerset. 

They're at the door to my cabin. It won't be long now. I beg the fates that word of this reaches the isle before it is too late.
