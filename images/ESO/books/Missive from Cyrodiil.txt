Missive from Cyrodiil

Graccus:

Your request for more infantry is denied. 

Your request for more supplies is denied.

Your request for more spymasters is denied.

Your orders were to go into Reaper's March and destablize the Dominion. Instead, you wasted half your resources destroying one valueless village, and the rest you squandered on a pointless book hunt.

You will receive no further Imperial support until you start contributing meaningfully to this war.

â€” Javad Tharn
