Morokei's Power

I am close to the power I seek! The Nords and their insipid burial sites leave the dead open for pillaging and pilfering by any fool with a sword. It is a wonder that the tombs scattered across this frozen land have anything left of value in them after all these centuries.

But this? This went beyond all of my hopes and expectations. The Dragon Priests of Nord legend possessed masks that bestow incredible power upon the wearer. The challenge, of course, is separating each from its owner. The priest in this particular ruin, who I came to know as Morokei, is kept sealed in restless slumber by protective wards. I must first crack these before I can unearth the Dragon Priest himself.

The lumbering undead in this ruin seem blind to the very presence of the warding fires, suggesting that they cannot affect them in any way. I, however, am no common skeleton or shambling corpse. It shall not be an overly difficult task to undo the magic on the warding flames, with a precise application of the proper reversal spells.

And unless the draugr start learning how to light torches and manage to trip into one of the braziers, the flames will stay extinguished long enough for me to finish the job.
