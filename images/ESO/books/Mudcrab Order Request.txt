Mudcrab Order Request

Some consider mudcrab to be the food of the common folks—the staple of a peasant. This is truly uninspired—such a versatile food is as essential to Tamriel as massive wheels of cheese.

I plan to compile the finest mudcrab recipes of Abah's Landing for publication. As such, I require a barrel of mudcrab meat to be delivered daily.

Not only will you be promoting local culture with your contribution, but I will also provide the typical payment for your services.
