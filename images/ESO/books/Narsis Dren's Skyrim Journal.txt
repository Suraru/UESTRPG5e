Narsis Dren's Skyrim Journal

That wretched librarian threw me out! Me! Narsis Dren! As if such a place was even worthy of my time. How that cadre of bumbling dullards got their hands on Maelmoth's journal, I'll never know.

I found a peculiar scroll tucked between the pages detailing a "ritual of reversal." I doubt that scaly book-hoarder even knew it was there! So, to my way of thinking, there's no harm in taking it with me.

Now, as for Maelmoth's journal itself, I was only able to jot down the aforementioned passageâ€”the bit about reversals. From what I can ascertain, this ritual exists in three parts. The text likely points to the location of three verses that must be read aloud in order to complete the spell. Another scavenger hunt! How droll. I've transcribed these directions below. 

Mind your nose, you zealous readers. A vessel once filled often cracks!
Should you find yourself gazing through glass, find a friend who'll heed these words:

The well of wisdom often runs dry for those with boastful, prying eyes,
The only thing that lasts longer than stone is a song,
In years of peril, in an era yet to come, mages shall nest in these stones like swallows.

I can only hope this scroll contains less nonsense! Let the studies begin!
