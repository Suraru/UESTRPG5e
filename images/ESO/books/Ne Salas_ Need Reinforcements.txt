Ne Salas: Need Reinforcements

Urgent - Expedited response requested.

The Daggerfall Covenant has infiltrated the ruins of Ne Salas north of the Gray Mire. Their numbers are swelling in a manner that suggests they have a concealed passage into Grahtwood. I do not have the manpower to halt their progress. 

Please send reinforcements immediately.
