Nel's Hidden Loves

You who quibble,
          Disagree, take sides:
Relics of song,
	        Encyphered here hide.

Bards' legend first,
					I keep it with me.
Its import true
					Though worn lovingly.

Haafingar, go!
          The hilt of a blade.
Jade shadows hide
          Magnificent caves.
At western mine
          A long storehouse march.
Dragged across two
          Holds, steady an Arch.
Great creature's home,
          Westest of Western.
North frost grotto
          Frigid, sequestered.

Hjaalmarch; A Jarl
          Holds court above all.
Stirring Nord graves.
          A maze of cold walls!
Towers that lower
          Bear weight of great tales.
Following sleep,
          The seas this one sails.

To Karthald; Turn
          Winds. Watching Jarl's foes.
Fall upon South.
          Brisk breezes freeze toes.

Then to the Dark;
          A Dwemer does take.
Empty, falls light
          At waterfall's break.
Sunsets in dark,
          Miners do covet.
A junk-heap's gem,
          Lord Chaurus above it.
Towers do form
          From fungus that grow.
Deep keep above
          and lava below.
