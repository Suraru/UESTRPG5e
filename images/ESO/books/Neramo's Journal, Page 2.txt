Neramo's Journal, Page 2

I have resolved to leave these pages as a trail to my body. Macabre, I know, but the discoveries I make must be shared with the world!

I am wracked with guilt for unwittingly leading the good Orcs of the quarry to their deaths. But I'm even more ashamed that I feel a little thrill each time I discover something new about this ruin. It is wrong that I should take such pleasure from these explorations, knowing what they have cost?

I suppose it's academic at this point. All that remains is the work. I can't bring the quarry workers back to life, but I can take rubbings and samples from these devices. This ruin is a treasure trove. If only it were less dangerous.
