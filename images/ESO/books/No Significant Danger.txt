No Significant Danger

Foreman Fabricius,

It has come to my attention that you find our camp defenses inadequate. Your concerns have been noted, but we require every able hand for the excavation. We are making tremendous discoveries, and I will not have that pace slowed. I have left a small but capable group of fighters to defend the supply train. I assure you—you are in no significant danger.

We make for the ruins of Volenfell. Should any communication prove necessary, please send a runner to the location indicated on the map.
