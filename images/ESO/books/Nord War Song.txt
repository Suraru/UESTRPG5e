Nord War Song

Take your fill of golden mead,
Let it spill like blood across your blade.
The horns of battle call upon the strongest,
Only in war are warriors made.

Hone your axes til they gleam,
Like a light upon the frozen snow.
Relish in the sweet, sweet sound, 
As it nestles in the breast of your foe.

No true Nord fears death,
They hold it in high regard! 
Take courage, those with hearts so bold,
A place awaits you in Sovngarde!

There's a cry in every warrior's heart,
A triumphant, hearty, mighty toll.
Ysgramor's courage steadies your hand,
His strength imbues your soul.

No true Nord fears death,
They hold it in high regard! 
Take courage, those with hearts so bold,
A place awaits you in Sovngarde!
