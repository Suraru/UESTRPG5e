Note from Captain Accalia

Engannas, 

Here is your share of the loot. You killed more of those filthy priests than any of the others so I am awarding you the Dagger of Mara as your prize. Once the Stonefire Cult has paid me for the Chalice you will receive an additional measure of coin. 

â€” Captain Accalia
