Note from Khezuli's Contact

K—

My employer's new arrangement makes it harder to meet in public. Get me the base mixture and I'll get you the payment. I hope you haven't forgotten how to combine the ingredients in the mixing mechanism. All you have to remember is keep things orderly.

Just add each ingredient carefully. The sweet, sticky <<z:1>>, the bitter <<z:2>>, and the viscous <<3>> all combine to produce our product. Once you're finished, meet me on the beach at the location I've marked on the map inside this journal.

Hope that's clear enough. If it's not, you may have to do it over and over again!
