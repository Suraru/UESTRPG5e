Note from Razum-dar

Hello, impatient friend!

You left before we could finish our business, but do not be worried. You are fitting right in, yes? In this, we are alike.

But alas, I am a busy Khajiit. I have no time to uncover why the dead rise in <<Ac:1>>. Nor why the Sea Vipers pick through smashed Dominion ships at <<2>>.

Perhaps you will know, one day soon. On that day, seek out the fine-looking Khajiiit by the bridge to <<3>> and I'll trade curiosity for coin.

Your new friend,
â€”Razum-dar
