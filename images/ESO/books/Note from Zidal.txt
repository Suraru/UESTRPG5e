Note from Zidal

Our contract is binding, and yes, I do expect you to follow through with the exploration.

Take your team and head to <<Ac:1>> by tomorrow, or I'll bring this before the treethane. You don't want to risk that, considering you jilted her son after she'd spent all that gold on things for the feast, do you?

I didn't think so.

Get going.
