Oath of a Dishonored Clan

By Lyranth

Resting never again until our purpose be achieved.

Ever watchful for an opportunity to repay the wrong.

Valkynaz Seris: We shall extract the fee for betrayal.

Even our duty to the Overkyn is transcended by this.

Never again to hear the name Foolkillers Clan: agony.

Generous will we be to those who aid our purpose:

Ending the false ascendance of the Deathbringer Clan.
