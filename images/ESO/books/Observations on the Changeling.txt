Observations on the Changeling

The loss of the Changling's corporeal form does not appear to inhibit my attempts at dissection, or her ability to vocalize her displeasure. Her spiritual body is similar to that of other souls unbound from their flesh that persist in Mundus. I have harvested small portions of ectoplasm for further examination, but I dare not push Selene's endurance too hard so soon after death.

Selene tugs at her bindings like any other wild animal. Bucking and braying until broken. I expected more from a reasoning creature, but it is a reminder that though she may take the form of Mer, she is not one. Once she's tired herself out I may continue testing her mutability in this form.

I must relocate. This vile forest is rife with damp, mold, and fungus. Preserving what's left of Selene's corpse is proving impossible. The wilderness to the south should be less humid and still near enough to Valenwood to preserve any ethereal links to it that the Changeling may have.

Spoilage ruined half of the reagents taken from the Changeling's body. I would be more upset by the loss if I were not already inundated with lines of research to pursue. It will not pose any significant setback if my theory that her body will reform in much the same manner as Daedra that are slain holds true.

* * *
Amputation poses no long-term harm to the Changeling, as expected. The loss of ectoplasm diminishes the spirit temporarily but has no lasting effect on their overall composition. Sadly, I did not have the opportunity to observe whether the same can be said for a Changeling's physical form.

* * *
Selene seems weaker today. Perhaps I've overestimated the extent of her recovery. I'll focus my efforts on the materials from her corpse and allow her to regain some of her strength. Not too much though.
