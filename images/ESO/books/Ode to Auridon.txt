Ode to Auridon

Of all the lands in the Summerset Isles,
Auridon, she outshines them all.
With her marble halls and towering spires,
Her beauty surpass'd them all.

From Vulkhel Guard to the First among Holds,
Her strength outstrips them all.
In shadowed glade and quiet ruin,
Her calm surprises all.

In steel and ship and flopping fish,
Her coin out-trades them all.
With beauty and wit and subtle grin,
Her Queen is best of all.
