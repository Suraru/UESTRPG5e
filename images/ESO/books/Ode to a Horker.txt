Ode to a Horker

A Poem by Drusk the Would-Be Bard

I sit upon a silent dock and look upon a frozen sea
To stare at horkers frolicking so fancy free.

In water and on ice they scamper
Their barks and calls like so much banter.

I laugh with glee at the large bull, Albakross
Whose antics remind me of a bucking horse.
