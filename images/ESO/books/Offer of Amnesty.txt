Offer of Amnesty

To the Occupants of Watcher's Hold,

Scholars reviewing Daggerfall's royal archives indicate a group of knights were long ago stationed at your location. They were mandated with preventing the Orcs from ever rebuilding Orsinium.

I, your new king, must inform you the situation has changed. The Orcs are our staunch allies whom I have allowed to rebuild Orsinium.

Your long vigil is over. It's time to come home. Cease your banditry and murder of Orc travelers.

I send my <<z:1>> with this offer: total amnesty and a chest full of gold to compensate you for your service. Cease your activities and report to Sergeant Oufa in Orsinium. If you do not heed this order, I will send the Lion Guard to exterminate you all.

Yours truly,
High-King Emeric
