Old Nord Drinking Song

I climbed Shearpoint Mountain,
Drinking my store of mead.
My vision got so blurry,
I couldn't hardly read.

I found a warm dry cave,
Never saw a sign or warning.
Curled up with an old frost troll,
Which surprised us both come morning.

Mead, mead, mead, mead!
It's all you really need.
It's sweet and it's strong,
So good it can't be wrong,
Mead, mead, mead, mead!

Gave that troll a bottle,
She drank it down right quick.
She danced around me happily,
Then hit me with a stick.

The old troll was snoring,
When I woke hours later.
She'd drunk up all my mead,
But I couldn't really hate her.

Mead, mead, mead, mead!
It's all you really need.
It's sweet and it's strong,
So good it can't be wrong,
Mead, mead, mead, mead!
It's all you really need.
It's sweet and it's strong,
So good it can't be wrong,
Mead, mead, mead!
