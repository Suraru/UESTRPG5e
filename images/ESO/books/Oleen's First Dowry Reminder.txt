Oleen's First Dowry Reminder

Hello, you crook-clawed rapscallions. I've had just about enough of you helping yourselves to whatever you please and throwing off my inventory counts. If you're so determined to waste my time, then I'll be sure to waste yours! I'll even give you a fighting chance. Start in the goods-pavilion and remember this:

Where do we hide things a Root-House might seize?
Inside an eye that never sees!
