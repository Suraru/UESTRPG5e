Oleen's Second Dowry Reminder

Well, well, well. You managed to finally hit the bulls-eye. Sure it wasn't luck? Might want to give up now before you've piddled away your day banging the flint-rocks between your ears for a spark of genius. If you intend to be stubborn, make your way to the corral and remember these words:

This blade finds use on fields of war,
But only for those who can wield it no more.
