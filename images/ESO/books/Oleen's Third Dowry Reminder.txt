Oleen's Third Dowry Reminder

Every time I get a little down about this trip, I just imagine you up to your elbows in guar dung trying to find your "dowry," but I guess you finally managed to get your hands on this clue. Did you just jam your hands into anything you could find until you got what you wanted? Might need to use salamander traps next time. 

If you think you're getting closer to your prize, go to the watchtower and think on these words:

I wear a skin that isn't mine.
With others' hands I help keep time.

-Oleen

Also, take a bath before the bonding you feckless heathen.
