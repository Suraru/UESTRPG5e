On Apocrypha

What takes the world in lightened sense
Can also seek the outward gleam
They rob the all of essence to
Report the nothing they have seen

Bone extrusions gash and grind
In moistened depths of smacking heat
While tearing flesh from averse bone
The body whole prepares to eat

A writhing mass of heaped appendage
Slipping grasp the squirming slick
Extend the reach to touch the face
Burn the mind, reveal the quick

Crushing razors, hollow shells
That snap, that twitch, that cinch and rend
To hold the subject, bodily,
'Til mind blows soft and life meets end
