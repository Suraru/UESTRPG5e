One Dragon Two Dragon

One Dragon, two Dragon
Red Dragon, blue Dragon.

One set free from a cage
Many in the sky form a murderous rage.

Some are cruel, some are fast
Some will flame you as they pass.

Dragons will freeze you 
Or burn you to bits
Fling you with shouts
Or drop you in pits!

Look to the sky
At dawn or at night
You may see Dragons
In murderous flight!

What makes Dragons mad?
Why do they stay?
I do not know
I just run away!
