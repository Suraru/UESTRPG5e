Ordinator Edict: Mandate Seven

Let it be known:

The Order of Inquisition has received reports of outsiders wearing the holy Ordinator's Regalia, to wit, the Golden Mask of Devotion and Robes of Triune Faith. This is a clear breach of the Seventeenth Dictum of Piety. Any member of the Dunmer laity who wears the Regalia shall be subject to swift and merciless sanction. Any non-Dunmer seen wearing the Regalia shall be killed on sight. Such is the price of blasphemy. 

You are hereby warned.

Victory for the Three,

Inquisitor Nivos Uveran
