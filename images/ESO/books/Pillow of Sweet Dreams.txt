Pillow of Sweet Dreams

Poem by Honoria Aurrus 
Transcribed by Relicmaster Glenadir

Head upon my pillow rest
Sweet dreams play behind my eyes
I long once more for sleep to come
For day would drown me with its lies

My lover lays beside me then
Her smile bright, her skin aglow
Death cannot contain her then
But morning comes and she must go

I will sleep once more
And never wake
My soul this night
Shall take
