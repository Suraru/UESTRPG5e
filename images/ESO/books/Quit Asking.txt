Quit Asking

You're not getting a discount! I don't want to hear any reasons why, especially if you:

—Grew up in the same village I did. What a coincidence!
—Know a "very reputable" supplier you'll introduce me to.
—Are just a few gold short but are "totally good for it."
—Saw the exact same item for far less elsewhere but like me better.
—Claim to be a member of the Morag Tong.

In fact, if you claim you're a member of the Morag Tong, I'll just let them know you're running around and telling people that. Go ahead, try me.
