Ra'khajin's Journal, Page 25

The time has come to leave Pridehome. I have learned all there is to know about the guardian Alkosh, but too little of the truth of my birth. Too little of my place in this world and what comes after. Too little about why we now deceive our own people with riddles and lies.

I begin to see it is all a game. A game played by she who has always sat above us, glowering down with Moons-lit eyes. Azurah. What do you want from me? Or is it simply this? For me to finally know that I am nothing except what you made me?

I reject it. I have learned all there is to know about Alkosh, including his breaking. If such as he can be overthrown, then Azurah's shackles can be shattered too.

I renounce you. I have learned all there is to know about Alkosh, and the many spirits that followed after him. They are old and powerful, like you. But they are not all gone. Not yet.

It is long past time for the Khajiit to crown a new leader. Soon you will see.
