Ralion's Journal, Day 151

â€¦ and the search party's been missing nearly two days. I can't send another one out. Since <<1>> disappeared, the forest seems darker. Menacing, even.

I'm not sure how to explain it. The shadows move in the corner of my eye. <<2>> says I need sleep. He's one to talk, the hours he keeps! Suppose it doesn't make him wrong. But every time I close my eyes, I see <<1>>, still out there in the woods.

Fists of Thalmor will be here the day after next. Worse comes to worst we'll get them to find our missing people.
