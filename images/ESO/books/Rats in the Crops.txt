Rats in the Crops

Headwoman <<1>>,

Some of our homes were damaged in the storm and a great many rats have set upon our crops. While we have the rats in hand, we would inquire as to when we might expect help.

None of us at <<2>> are skilled architects. While a few of us can make simple repairs, we cannot fix everything without help from <<3>>.

We will do what we can while we wait for your word.

Ever your servant,

â€” <<4>>
