Rhanbiq's Notes

Entry 28
<<1>> certainly passed through the area, but enough time has passed that few remember the details. "Bellulor would know," is what everyone tells me. Apparently they mean <<2>>, some gossipy pickpocket who comes in here to cadge drinks.

But not since I began asking around. He must think I'm with the local Guard, and has gone to ground wherever he and the rest of his ilk do business. But where would a pickpocket go to avoid the Guard? It's not as though all the outlaws in town have some sort of refuge.
