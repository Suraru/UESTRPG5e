With Dominion stickypaws crawling around <<1>>, we must keep production low. No outgoing shipments! Hide everything but unprocessed barrels. If the stickypaws ask, say moon-sugar stores best in cool places. That's all the Wind Tunnels areâ€”a cool place for sugar storage.

Jone and Jode may have sent us a savior. One of our runners met a Dominion sailor who doesn't mind a little gold on the side. If the old sea-cat's vessel makes it off the shoals, we have a way to make <<Ac:2>> run.
