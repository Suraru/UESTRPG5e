Royal Decree

By decree of <<1>>, the Court Mage <<2>> is henceforth stripped of all titles, duties, and rights accorded to him by his position.

The outcast <<2>> is furthermore banished from the Summerset Isles for his crimes against the citizenry of the Dominion.

By the will of the queen, he has one week to remove himself from the heart of the Dominion, or face charges most serious. And consequences most fatal.

By the Queen's hand!
