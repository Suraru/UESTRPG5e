Memorandum on Mnemic Acquisition

Initial experiments uncovered a formula to duplicate the mnemic phenomenon. We've yet to replicate the processes utilized by a "Tree-Minder," yet our solution is both elegant and thorough.

The Hist sap proves to be an invaluable by-product. I hope to bring many specimens back to the Crystal Tower to further research possible uses.

Most Argonian subjects prove uncooperative, but we've had some success using the extractions from the Hist as a crude form of coercive.

This warrants a full investigation, one which I will personally oversee.
