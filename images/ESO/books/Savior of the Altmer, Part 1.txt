Savior of the Altmer, Part 1

Let it be known that what I have done here, in Elden Hollow, I do for the Altmer, though they refuse to help themselves.

What follows is a memoir of sorts, for the Thalmor will no doubt feel they have been betrayed. But I am the only Canonreeve working towards a greater good—towards a better existence for the Altmer.

12th of Morning Star
I have seen the numbers. The Aldmeri Dominion loses hundreds of soldiers every fortnight in this accursed war—and we have a long road ahead of us.

When all is finished, we will have lost an entire generation of Altmer. Teachers, scholars, and mages march off to fiery death and the Thalmor are happy to give them up. It's heinous.

I can understand that the Khajiiti leaders (with less than five of their number in the Thalmor!) and the Bosmeri Treethanes would be eager to offer Altmeri blood to end this conflict. But my fellow Canonreeves are equally willing, and I cannot abide by it.

8th of Mid Year
Months have passed and the Thalmor continue to pass Altmeri youth through the Dominion war machine like they're an inexhaustible resource. We possess the greatest military minds in Tamriel and all we can do is tear our best and brightest from their lives to fight like savages in far-off lands.

9th of Last Seed
I was a fiery mage in my youth, and I've retained a lesson or two since then. If I cannot get support from the Thalmor to bring a more expedient end to this war, then I will bring about the end for them.
