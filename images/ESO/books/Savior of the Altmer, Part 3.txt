Savior of the Altmer, Part 3

1st of Morning Star
The pact is made. I fear even my ancestors would frown on me, or hunt me in the streets for this. I do not doubt the Thalmor will be displeased.

But it is necessary. I have taken a sabbatical from my position as Canonreeve these last months in my effort to conclude this war, but I have been reviewing the field reports. This conflict is claiming double the Altmeri lives as were being lost when I embarked on my journey.

The choice I made was the correct one.

My new master, and the army he has promised, will ensure this war is finished before the year's end.
