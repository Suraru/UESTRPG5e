Scrap of Storgh's Journal

Left <<1>> in <<2>>. Stupid Wood Elf finally did one thing right, stealing this bow. Wish I could see the look on his face when he realizes I took it. Thinks I'm not smart. Thinks I can't outwit a tree-brain like him.

Locals say there's a treasure buried in this cave. But they avoid it because of the stranglers. Imagine that. Afraid of plants. Elves are so pathetic.

*****
Can't sleep. Keep hearing something coming from the cave. Singing? Or wailing? Hard to tell, Never had much of an ear for music. 

Sick of it. Don't need to wait for morning. I'm going in.
