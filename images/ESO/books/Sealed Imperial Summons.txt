Sealed Imperial Summons

<<1>>,

Your exploits continue to impress. A matter of some urgency has come to my attention. It requires utmost care and unbridled attention. Therefore, you are summoned to appear before me posthaste so that we may deal with this in a timely fashion. Find me in one of the following locations, the one that belongs to your particular alliance: the Mages Guildhall in Davon's Watch, the Vulkhel Guard Manor and Treasury, or the Royal Castle in Daggerfall.

Do hurry. Not a one of us is getting any younger.

A. Tharn
