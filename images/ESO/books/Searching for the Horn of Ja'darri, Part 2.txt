Searching for the Horn of Ja'darri, Part 2

Written by Commander Oholin of the Dragonguard

After scouring the tomes of Storm Talon, I finally discovered that the Horn of Ja'darri is housed in Dark Water Temple. We should find the entrance to this sanctuary a little ways south of Windhelm, in Eastmarch.

I also found records that indicate something a bit hard to believe. According to several reports, the Dragonhorn we seek is indestructible, both from physical and magical means. I know of no other Dragonhorn that had such a power. How was the Dragonguard able to create this weapon?

It also makes me curious as to what matter of Dragon the Horn of Ja'darri was carved from. It must have been a truly powerful beast. Was he called Ja'darri? It seems unlikely, given the name's distinctly Khajiiti sound. 

Let us hope that when we find the Dragonhorn, so too shall we uncover its secrets.
