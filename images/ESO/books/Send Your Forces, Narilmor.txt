Send Your Forces, Narilmor

Narilmor,

Will you wait until the Men are at your gates before you raise your sword against them? Enough excuses. The coast is clear and the storm is inland, leave your vigil and march to war. Our siege at Mzulft will fail if our supply lines are not maintained and they cannot reach us by sea!

The Wrathstone is nearly in hand, don't throw it away out of stubborn Meridian obligation!
