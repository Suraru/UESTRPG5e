Sharfum's Letter

Father,

I know you will be disappointed, so I am leaving at night, when you aren't around to look upon me.

You know where I have gone. To the new city. I have decided to join the priesthood of Trinimac.

You will blame Sneg, but you should not. I made this decision on my own. If you must know the reason, it is that for a long time I was ashamed to be an Orc. While other peoples grow strong and proud with their great cities—Shornhelm, Stormhaven, Daggerfall, Mournhold, Evermore—we Orcs languish without a home. In Orsinium, I no longer need to be ashamed. 

Whenever you find this, and whatever you think of it, I want you to know that I will always love you and that I was never ashamed of you.

Your daughter, Sharfum
