Shipyard Workers, Take Warning!

SPIES ARE EVERYWHERE!

The ships we are building are destined for the Thrice-Blessed Alliance of the Daggerfall Covenant—agents of the Ebonheart Pact and the Aldmeri Dominion may be spying upon our work AT ANY TIME. 

BEWARE OF SABOTEURS!

Ships on the ways are vulnerable to sabotage, especially from fire. This is especially likely to be attempted at night. BE ALERT FOR SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY.

REMEMBER: OPEN EYES TO STOP THE SPIES!
