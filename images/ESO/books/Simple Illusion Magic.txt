VIII.d: Ritual Life Force Binding For Sustained Illusionary Projection: Completion

To end the ritual, simply tune each crystal in turn. The colors of the lights to either side of the crystal will combine to create a new color within. Red and Yellow into Orange, and so on. A sound will also be heard when you have it right. 

Beware. Without maintenance of the spell-lattice, the ritualist can quickly find her life energies consumed in the illusionary suspension she has created.
