Sister Elra's Proclamation

Brothers and sisters in the Reach,

Know this! A powerful army awakens and our sacred work gives it strength. Our power grows and our rewards will be numerous as the ancient army reclaims its place in the world.

The wise and ageless Ashen Lord praises our efforts. Every harvest we provide returns more of his beloved kin to his side. This is how it should be. This is good.

Some of you question our work. Some of you fear our allies. Know this! The ritual of the harrowstorm is glorious! It provides what the Ashen Lord requires while also filling our enemies with fear. 

We have perfected the ritual. Made it more powerful. Now only a single pike is needed to call forth a storm. It will not be a large storm, but it will harvest the life force we need all the same.

So be strong and do as the coven commands. Seek not the light, but praise the gray!

Sister Elra
