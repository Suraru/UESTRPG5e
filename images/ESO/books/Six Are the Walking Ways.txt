Six Are the Walking Ways

(A Traditional Song)

Six are the walking ways, enigma, enemy, teachers
Begat by precursor gods, come we now their creatures
Embody splendor in your name, and wisdom in your features

By the sword I mean the night
By the word I mean the dead
By the sword I mean a sigh
By the word I mean the end

Six are the guardians, three fore and three incarnate
Here to test your hero's ways, and show that you can learn it
The truest works we shall behold are those made by the silent

By the sword I mean the night
By the word I mean the dead
By the sword I mean a sigh
By the word I mean the end
