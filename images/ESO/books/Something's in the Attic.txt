Something's in the Attic

Something's in the attic, it stinks of blood and meat.
Something's in the attic, I hear its scuttling feet.
Something's in the attic, it's whispering to me.
Something's in the attic, I shouldn't set it free.

Something's in the attic, I really have no choice.
Something's in the attic, it's making so much noise.
Something's in the bedroom, my eyes are open wide.
Something's in my mirror, staring from inside.
