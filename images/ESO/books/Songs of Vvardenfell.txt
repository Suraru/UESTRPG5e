Armiger Marching Song

Step light, stride far,
O ye Buoyant Armigers,
To glory days and triumphant nights,
March on through your bloody fight!

Sing proud, sound roars,
O ye Buoyant Armigers,
Raise voices in courageous cheers,
Give those heathens cause for fear!

Stand tall, spoil wars,
O ye Buoyant Armigers,
Best their warriors by the score,
Take a bow and best a dozen more!

Set bones, sum scars,
O ye Buoyant Armigers,
Wear the badge of those who lead,
A few new nicks as proof of deeds!

Stand tall, spoil wars,
O ye Buoyant Armigers,
Best their warriors by the score,
Take a bow and best a dozen more!

Six are the Walking Ways

Six are the walking ways, enigma, enemy, teachers
Begat by precursor gods, come we now their creatures
Embody splendor in your name, and wisdom in your features

By the sword I mean the night
By the word I mean the dead
By the sword I mean a sigh
By the word I mean the end

Six are the guardians, three fore and three incarnate
Here to test your hero's ways, and show that you can learn it
The truest works we shall behold are those made by the silent

By the sword I mean the night
By the word I mean the dead
By the sword I mean a sigh
By the word I mean the end

The Song of the Word

The words you hear are based on meat—don't let the sophists fool you
Fear not upon the walking way—just let hysteria rule you
In their own world, the mad have laws—but only if they're written
The wise can write them different rules—for by the word they're smitten

Use no words for apologies—if you seek absolution
Action is the walking way— and words are no solution
The wise avoid apology—when ravers must be beaten
So sing not with the dusty tongue—no word is true till eaten
