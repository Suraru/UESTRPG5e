Speakers of Nothing

By Nisswo Xeewulm

Nothing-talkers, nothing words
Void clinging to their nothing tongues
A thousand tongues and tenfold words
Truth steady as their nothing lungs

Their breath of wisdom fouls the air
Like the fruit so long decayed
Darkness sticks between their words
Nothing between the something

Their feet will walk many paths
Lined by the Hists' many roots
Their lips will speak many truths
Truths that spread like candlelight

No comfort will they offer you
No gentle truths to placate fear
But listen closely to their words
Look upon their nothing eyes
