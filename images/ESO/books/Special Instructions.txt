Special Instructions

In two days, you are to leave your post as the bell tolls midnight and return no sooner than ten minutes later. Do not deviate or there will be consequences. You'll find your payment at the usual place.

Remember, this arrangement benefits everyone. Do not even think of breaking the vow you made to me. After all, I'd hate to see anything happen to your little ones.

Remember, two days from now, at midnight, until ten minutes have past. Don't mess this up.
