Stagger and Sway

O my sweet love, she waits for me,
Through storm and shine, cross land or sea.
I run to her and together we,
Sway as we kiss
Sway as we kiss

Her graceful shape I heave on high
And in one hand I hold her nigh
Her waiting lips are never dry
Sway as we kiss
Sway as we kiss

Come the morn she goes
The taste of her remains
And in my mind, I see us sway
Sway as we kiss
Sway as we kiss
