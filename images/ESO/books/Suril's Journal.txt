My latest research project involves plants. What destination is better than Shadowfen? There's something about this place. The moisture hanging in the air encourages so much growth. I'm sure I'll find a new species to study.

I hate rain. It's rained every day for the past month. The ground is saturated, making it impossible to do any meaningful field studies. Clearly, I chose the wrong time of year to come to Stormhold.

On the bright side, I've had time to rearrange the guildhall to suit myself … well, one room of it, at least. I've never had this much time or space to myself, especially after the incident at Davon's Watch. I was so sure. Well, every researcher makes mistakes now and then. It's part of the process.

I've discovered a remarkable lichen specimen. It's on the spine of my "Lexicon of Black Marsh Flora."

Wrote to the arch-mage. Requested a new assignment, preferably one in the Alik'r.
