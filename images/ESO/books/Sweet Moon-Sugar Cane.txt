Sweet Moon-Sugar Cane

(A Khajiiti Working Song)

The Wood Elves have their rotmeth brew
Made of meat and bile
The lizards eat their bugs and twigs
And everything so vile

But those of us who walk the sands
Know life's greatest pleasure
Is strictly sweet, a tasty treat
It's moon-sugar that we treasure!

CHORUS
Fields drenched in moonlight
Dewed with summer rain
Brilliant green and growing tall
Sweet moon-sugar cane!
Sweet moon-sugar cane!

Gifted by the Moons
As they wax and wane
Fill our bowls and fill our souls
Sweet moon-sugar cane!
Sweet moon-sugar cane!

We sprinkle it on fine steak
Glistening so sweetly
We smear it on our salmon
And gobble it up completely

We bake it into our sweet treats
Don't you want a taste?
So eat it quick and wash it down
Because nothing shall go to waste

CHORUS
Fields drenched in moonlight
Dewed with summer rain
Brilliant green and growing tall
Sweet moon-sugar cane!
Sweet moon-sugar cane!

Gifted by the Moons
As they wax and wane
Fill our bowls and fill our souls
Sweet moon-sugar cane!
Sweet moon-sugar cane!
