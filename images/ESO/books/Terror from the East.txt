Terror from the East

When Demons came to Khenarthi's land
She knew that this was fate
Her children made a final stand
And opened the Crimson Gate

First came Alkosh proud and strong
Golden crowned his golden mane
He saw these things did not belong
And that they must be slain

Down came mighty Lorkhaj then
His blade burned shining blue
He fought the darkness back again
and ran the Demons through

Last came Hircine mourning Nirni
Whose cairn he made of bone
From wooded green to blackened sea
He watched over her alone
