Thank You for Your Patience

<<1>>,

While we recognize bandit activity has increased along the roads, there is nothing we can do to address it at this time.

Many buildings along <<2>>—including piers and other vital port structures—were damaged in the storm and will require significant renovation.

Our architects estimate at least a month before they can begin rebuilding, and a further two before efforts are completed.

Furthermore, the arrival of so many Dominion refugees from the wreckage of the "Gold Fleet" strains the <<3>> guard to capacity.

Normal patrol patterns will resume once <<2>> is restored.

Thank you for your patience while we manage this crisis.
