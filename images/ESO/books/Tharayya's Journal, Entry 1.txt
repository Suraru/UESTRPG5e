Tharayya's Journal, Entry 1

It has been a long journey, but finally I am on the right path. Today I found the first mention of the Guardian's Eye in some of the old Dwemer inscriptions here.

I haven't even begun to sift through the writings yet. Surely there is something here that will get me closer to the Eye.

I've already sent word to my husband. As if that fool deserved any of the creditâ€”I wish he would hurry. Quintus "the Quick," he calls himself. Quick my arse.
