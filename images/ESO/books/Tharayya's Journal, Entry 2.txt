Tharayya's Journal, Entry 2

Though some of the initial excitement has faded, we're still confident we're closer to finding the Guardian's Eye than any Dwemer researchers before us. I would kill to get my hands on an ancient artifact of that repute. But I'm better at research, honestly.

There was a setback today. As far as I can make out, one of the old Dwemer logs indicates the Eye was here only briefly to be worked on (the logs mention some sort of maintenance or cleaning), and then was transported to another Dwemer mine.

As near as I can tell, the ruins referenced are those of Aldunz.
