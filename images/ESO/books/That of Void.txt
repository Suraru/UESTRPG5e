That of Void

By Nisswo Xeewulm

That which is eternal void
First creator, final destroyer
All that is born from nothing
Returned to nothing once again

Day that melts into the dusk
Life taken by a pointed thrust
Stone that crumbles into dust
Death that blooms back into life

Unwanted change, needed change
Growing, decaying, reborn again
Like the darkness, like your death
Nothing words on a dying breath

Seasons change, despite our will
All things change, despite our fear
Look upon that which is void
Look upon with open eyes
