The 26th of First Seed is Upon Us!

And you know what that means: the Festival of Blades! 

Celebrate the defeat of Malooc's Horde in regal style—right here at the Sisters of the Sands, where our cooks' blades are always festive! Our five-drake prix fixe dinner comes with all the festival fixings:

—	Scuttle Fondue with sandwort croutons

—	Goatherd and mutton pies, with garnishes of red mushroom and smoked viper

—	Horker Loaf on a bed of imported scathecraw

—	A bottle of Gold Coast Muscat to wash it down with

—	And Caramelized Goat Nibbles for the children!

All this, and we still promise to get you out into the street in plenty of time for the Effigy Dismemberment!

But we can only seat a limited number of revelers, and time is running out, so get your reservations in before it's too late! 

Because you don't want to be stuck at home with nothing for the family but mountain jerky or stale toad muffins—not on the Festival of Blades. 

See you then!
