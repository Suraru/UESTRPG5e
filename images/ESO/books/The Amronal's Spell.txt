The Amronal's Spell

Who has seen the Amronal of Valenwood? 
I thought I saw her drifting toward me,
like a woman I knew a long time ago.

But that was a different place,
much colder and not nearly so full of trees.
That was before I opened my eyes and shook off the sleep.

Now I walk the forest, not as a hunter,
but as a prey, hoping for a hunter,
hoping to be tracked, caught, and killed.

Wispmother, ethereal and strange,
do not be a ghost to me.
Snow Elf, do not be a legend.

Release me from this restless enchantment,
wrap me in your spell,
and let the last word on my lips be your name:

Amronal.
