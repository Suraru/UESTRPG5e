The Arena!

Drilegur,

I just found out that there's a huge exhibition planned at Thizrinni Arena next week. They're importing a whole pack of frost trolls and they're going to let the arena hopefuls try to fight them until all the trolls, or all the fighters, are dead.

It's going to be a bloodbath! We have to go!
