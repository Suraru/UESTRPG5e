The Ballad of Navid the Singer

In old Ra Gada days
When Forebears came ashore
Among them were sword-singers
According to the lore

At fore were Yaghoub's Thirteen
Noble Ansei all
One there was named Navid
This song is of his fall

Navid loved Sayeedeh
Sayeedeh loved him not
Her heart was pledged to Ihlqub
The Thirteen's finest shot

As Ihlqub plied his bow
In practice on the beach
Navid approached with empty hands
Until he was in reach

While Ihlqub faced the target
Navid called up his shehai
Slew his love's love with sacred sword
And watched his rival die

Back to Yaghoub's beachhead
Went into his tent
Fell for shame on his own sword
Dishonor thus was spent
