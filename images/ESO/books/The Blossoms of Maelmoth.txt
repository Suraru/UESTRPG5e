The Blossoms of Maelmoth

You follow instructions splendidly! But do you have a poet's heart?

Honor the Lady of Winter Winds and valor,
Draped in deepest chill, her love lights the way.
Two Mountain Flowers for the breath of mer and men,
Four Deathbell blooms for the grieving widow, cheeks wet with tears and brine,  
Three Dragon's Tongues for fiery, ancient throats,
And one last blossom for the kiss at the end.
