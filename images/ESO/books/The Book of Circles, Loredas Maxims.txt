The Book of Circles, Loredas Maxims

By Frandar Hunding

Thus on Loredas, Faithful Ones, do we consider these maxims of the Master:

"Train your opponent to make the wrong response."

"The worst action executed with vigor is superior to the best action executed timidly."

"A thrust is elegant, and a cut is powerful, but sometimes the right action is a head-butt."

"The high guard is most suitable for feints and crossovers, but mind your nether limbs."

"Your opponent's sword is not your enemy. Watch your opponent, not his sword."

"Perfection in the eight basic cuts is criticalâ€”though you will never use them in battle."

"A closed line is not open."
