The Book of Circles, Tirdas Maxims

By Frandar Hunding

Thus on Tirdas, Faithful Ones, do we consider these maxims of the Master:

"The sword is the self. Its edge is the mind."

"To shed the mantle of fear is to cast it upon your enemy."

"Shouting to halt the sands' shifting only leaves you hoarse."

"Prepare to pay for victory in blood, but do not waste a drop."

"The victor's tempo grasps his opponent's and devours it."

"The Seventy-Ninth Strike: the spear of the fisherman sharpened at daybreak."

"Live and die in every moment of battle."
