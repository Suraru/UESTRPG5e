The Danger of Morokei

The Dragon Priests embody a memory from a dark time in Nord history, when proud folk cowered and knelt before the mighty Dragons. They begged for scraps of the Dragons' glory, to the ruin and misery of their own kin.

Know that across Skyrim, many of these Dragon Priests were entombed after the end of the ancient wars, but they did not rest easy. Many would not stay dead. Among these was Morokei.

When Morokei lived, he dwelt in the ruin we know as Labyrinthian. Once, many lifetimes ago, it was known as the city of Bromjunaar and was the seat of the Dragon Priests' power. After Morokei's defeat, the full extent of the power gifted to him by the Dragons became clear â€” he could not be killed save by the voice of a Dragon itself.

I, and other priests of Kyne, keep the restless priests within their tombs by way of four sacred fires. By keeping these braziers lit, we seal the tomb with warding magic. This is our secret and holy purpose. If any fool seeking the power of Morokei were to intrude upon this place and break the seal, the Dragon Priest's vengeance upon Skyrim would be swift and terrible.

But I grow old, and the vigor of my heart and bones fades with each passing year. One day, soon, I must ask my granddaughter, Yrsild, to take up this mission in my stead. She is devout in the ways of Kyne and will understand the dire importance of this sacred duty.
