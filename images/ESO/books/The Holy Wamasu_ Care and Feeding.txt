The Holy Wamasu: Care and Feeding

While the holy wamasu will eat anything, a wise keeper ensures a variance in its diet to keep the sacred beast happy and content. When the wamasu is content, the keeper is happy â€¦ and safe.

Do not overfeed the holy wamasu, however! A bloated lightning dragon discharges its excess in several ways. Some are distasteful; others are dangerous.

Experiment with a mix of mudcrabs, kagouti, and Bosmer. Remember, the holy wamasu prefers a live diet, so keep its meal both healthy and whole until feeding time.
