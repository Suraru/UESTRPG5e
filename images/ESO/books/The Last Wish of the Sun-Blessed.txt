The Last Wish of the Sun-Blessed

Translated by Solis Aduro

Though bathed in radiant glory
Skin of gold and bark
We have fallen short of the yolk
And now it is too late

But light without darkness is blinding
And the shadow always watches over us
It is here for us now, if we wish it
Though the toil to pay our debt will be long

We must, scales-of-gold
We must join with our brothers in the deep
No matter how much we lose

Our roots are patient
And we will rise again
In this world or the next
