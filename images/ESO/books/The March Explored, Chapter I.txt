The March Explored, Chapter I

Gentle reader, welcome. Welcome to open skies and red earth. To the fields of grass and savage landscape of Elsweyr. Welcome, reader, to the end of the world. To the Reaper's March. 

Herein, find an undedited journal of observations. Thoughts jotted down during my first trip across this stark landscape. Some of the hidden gems of the land, some of the most striking locales, will see description in these pages.

From I, your humble guide. Enjoy!
