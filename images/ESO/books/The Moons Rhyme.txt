The Moons Rhyme

Little moon, like a smile,
Set in a golden style.

Little moon, a gilded twin,
Adorned with a broad, wide grin.

Tall moon, proud moon,
Higher in the sky, it sets too soon.

Three moons in the night,
What an unusual sight.

Place the moons, per the rule,
Beside the small, tranquil pool.

Tall moon, smiling moon, and the gilded twin,
Set them right and the game you will win.
