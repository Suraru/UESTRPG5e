The Mysterium's Threshold

Kyne was kind, it seems! Ho ho! Fires mean warmthâ€”and you are getting warmer!

All doors lead somewhere, but some doors lead nowhere.
Might makes right, but right might be wrong,
Try just right of left, but it won't last long,
Left-most selections might lead to collections,
But third in a line can oft make one whine,

Now, hop to it! Like a cat, you must leap. Just have some feline faith and I'm sure you'll land safe!
