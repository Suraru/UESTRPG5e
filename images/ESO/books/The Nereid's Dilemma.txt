The Nereid's Dilemma

By Anthil Morvir

Consider now the problems of 
The nereid, bereft of love
A nereid is, without fail
Always female, never male
The chances for romance seem slender
In a race with but one gender
Given my proclivities 
For amorous activities
I'd rather be a woodland doe
Than nereid without a beau!
