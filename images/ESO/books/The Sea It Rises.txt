The Sea It Rises

(A Sea Chanty of the Long Coast)

The sea it rises with a mighty roar
The wind it blows from a distant shore
The waves they speed us on our way
The ship she dances in the spray!

All hands to halyards, hoist away!
Set sails to full and no delay!
The course we set we must sail true
Or sink ourselves in the briny blue!

Look to the port above the beach
Our destination we will reach
For our captain's is a will of steel
Break his trust and you'll kiss the keel!

The sea it settles on the shore
The wind will blow us nevermore
The waves are calm, there is no spray
Our ship sets sail some other day.
