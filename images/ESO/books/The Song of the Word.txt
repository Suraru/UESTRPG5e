The Song of the Word

(A Traditional Song)

The words you hear are based on meat—don't let the sophists fool you
Fear not upon the walking way—just let hysteria rule you
In their own world, the mad have laws—but only if they're written
The wise can write them different rules—for by the word they're smitten

Use no words for apologies—if you seek absolution
Action is the walking way—and words are no solution
The wise avoid apology—when ravers must be beaten
So sing not with the dusty tongue—no word is true till eaten
