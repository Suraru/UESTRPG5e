The Sonnet of Aetherius Art

This is our base, our most favorite place,
The beginning and end to each day.
It represents our triumphs and glories, 
The very walls tell our ongoing stories,
As they absorb everything we do and say.

This is our space, each corner laced,
With items all chosen with care.
From sweet-scented candles,
To decorative fixtures and handles,
The atmosphere is perfect to share.

So near or distant or ever so far, 
No matter where in Tamriel we are,
Wherever we choose to roam,
We live and we learn, then we always return,
To the place we simply call Home.
