By Ellya Erdain

Act VI, Scene II, continued
 
Croon-Tail: My lady, I could never perform your request!
 
Ellya Erdain: Oh? Is it too fast for you?
 
Croon-Tail: I fear that it might damage my instrument.
 
Ellya Erdain: Ah. But you seem to handle your instrument so well, my darling.
 
Croon-Tail: You flatter me, my lady.
 
Ellya Erdain: Yes, well it is such a large and magnificent piece. May I hold it?
 
Croon-Tail: Goodness, no! The innkeeper would never approve of such a public display.
 
Ellya Erdain: Then may I suggest a private performance? Perhaps, away from the noise of the inn where we both may enjoy your tremendous talent.
 
Croon-Tail: Surely you don't mean for me to accompany you to your room?
 
Ellya Erdain: Indeed I do, my sweet. Indeed I do.
