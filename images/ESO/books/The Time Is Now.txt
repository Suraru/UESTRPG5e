The Time Is Now

Time is immediate. The clash of arms, the roar of victory, the grief and tragedy of defeat â€¦ they all happen now. Moment-to-moment the world exists, or it doesn't. The past, the future; none are more important than the present.

I am forever free, regardless of whether the Hound's spell binds my body. Release me from my bonds if you will, knowing that what happens now is most important. Death is just another moment in time, and when it comes, I will endure it.

The Lady stands alone,
Her will by rituals besieged.

The Warrior stands alone,
His strength by liars mocked.

The Lord stands alone,
His rule by traitors taken.
