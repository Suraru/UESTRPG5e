The Time Is Past

Time flows like a river, sweeping away the flotsam and jetsam of history with every moment. If we look upstream, we see the white water of the past and can predict the turbulence of the present and the torrents of the future. All is as it once was.

I have been free in the past and shall be in the future, whether you break my bonds or not. The Silvenar has always been and so always shall be. Take comfort, or fear, in that.

Dance the endless dance, oh, children,
And cast the forever spell!

Learn your sacred rites,
Apprentice to your times.

The masters of magic, the mages
They shall compose the rhymes.
