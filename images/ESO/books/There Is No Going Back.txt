There Is No Going Back

<<1>>,

Our cause would be glad to have one so well versed in magic. Your former employer was foolish not to put your talents to better use, but his loss is our gain.

Join us in Abamath, but be warned! There is no going back. Cut ties with your former life. Distractions will not be tolerated in your service to the Black Worm.
