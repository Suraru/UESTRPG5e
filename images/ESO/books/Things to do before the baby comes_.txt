Things to do before the baby comes:

— Buy a new lamp for the house.

— Visit Aunt Abia in Sentinel.

— Finish reading "The Lusty Argonian Maid."

— Weave a new carpet for the wall in the baby's corner.

— Ask mother for the orange vases she has in the storeroom.

— Ask father to finally give us the chickens he promised as part of my dowry.

— Burn all my Forebear clothes and buy new Crown clothes.
