Tinkerer Tobin's Big Book of Crafting Recipes

Ha! I knew it!

Not only are you using my crafting stations free of charge, but you figured you'd learn the secrets of a master crafter by sneaking a peek into this book.

Well, the joke's on you! My book of crafting recipes is locked away and safe, far from your prying eyes, you thief!

Now, go get your own crafting recipes, milk-drinker!
