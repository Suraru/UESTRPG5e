To Grandmaster Sees-All-Colors

Grandmaster,

Your invitation is kind, and the promise of coin is appealing. The village could use it. 

Still, I must refuse your offer of membership in the Fighters Guild. Bleakrock is where I was born. Shor willing, it's where I will die. My bow and blade belong to this tiny island.

Kyne speed you on your mission against the Daedra. 

â€” Darj of Bleakrock
