To Smite with Dragon Claws

(Battle Chant of the Intrepid Two Hundred)

We are dragonknights. We are Dragons. 

If you attack us, you will meet talons.

If you strike us, you will eat spikes.

If you injure us, our wounds will close.

If you anger us, you will burn. 

If you run from us, we will pounce upon you.

You cannot win. We cannot lose.

We are dragonknights. We are Dragons.
