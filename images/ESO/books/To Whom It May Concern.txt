To Whom It May Concern

The Wood Elf Fingaenion is certain he knows a way into the planes of Oblivion. He's been studying, reading dark books that this Nord couldn't begin to comprehend. His wife disappeared there long ago, but if she yet lives—the Undaunted are going to get her back!

The great Undaunted excursion into Oblivion—that's what they'll call it, decades from now, when they sing our song! A song of the most dauntless of the Undaunted, charging headlong into the razors of Mehrunes Dagon! It won't be pretty, it might not even be wise, but it will be fun!

Tomorrow is the day. The day for us to rise above the ranks of even the Undaunted!

PS

To posterity—if we don't make it back (and the steady dilapidation of this camp will be a clue!)—then take this note to Glenumbra, to Mighty Mordra. She will know we died as we lived—as Undaunted!
