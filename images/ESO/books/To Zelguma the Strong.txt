To Zelguma the Strong

Zelguma,

Please continue your efforts in western Craglorn. With the help of the Iron Orcs, the Scaled Court will soon control the entire region. 

And remember, your resolution and steadfast loyalty will be well rewarded. Perhaps you'd like to wear the robes of the next Minister of Writhing Worms?
