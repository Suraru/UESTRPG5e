Today's Instructions

Zan'ikh,

Use Freiwen's amulet to protect you from the storm while you search for fresh bodies, but take care not to lose it.

Locations to search:
~ Recently icebound merchant ship 
~ Along the ice shelf south of the stronghold

Items to acquire:
~ Humanoid corpses
~ 1 wolf corpse
~ 1 Argonian corpse

Return to my workshop beneath Verglas Hollow with these items, or don't return at all.
