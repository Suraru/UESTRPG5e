Tome of the Undaunted

We, the undersigned, declare our intention to take the Pledge of the Undaunted. Be we longstanding members of the guild, or newly blooded blades, we will dare to do what others will not. We will delve beneath Nirn, we will seek out knowledge and treasure where it lies unseen. We will stand against the darkness.

And we will return Undaunted.

Signed,
