Tu'whacca's Prayer

Tu'whacca, God of the Far Shores
We ask for your blessing and guidance
On this completed walkabout
May she appear before your throne
In virtue and strength
Lead her along the path of the stars
Show her the way
Prepare her for the life to come
As our honored ancestor
With her sword at her side
