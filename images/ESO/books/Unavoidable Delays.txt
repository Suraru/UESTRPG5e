Unavoidable Delays

<<1>>,

While we realize the outlying farms sustained damage in the storm, we regret to inform you that we cannot facilitate repairs until our own restoration efforts are complete.

Many buildings along <<2>>—including piers and other vital port structures—were damaged in the storm and will require significant renovation.

Our architects estimate at least a month before they can begin rebuilding, and a further two before efforts are completed.

Furthermore, the arrival of so many Dominion refugees from the wreckage of the "Gold Fleet" strains the <<3>> guard to capacity.

Once <<2>> is restored, we will endeavor to provide you with whatever you require.

Thank you for your patience while we manage this crisis.

— Office of the <<3>> Chancery
