Urgent Message from Walks-Softly

<<1>>,

While we were both attending to other matters, that special shipment from my past was discovered and absconded with by pirates. I have to rescue her!

Contacts throughout Abah's Landing have told me that the shipment has been taken to <<2>>. I'm heading there immediately. If you have the inclination, I wouldn't turn down your help.
