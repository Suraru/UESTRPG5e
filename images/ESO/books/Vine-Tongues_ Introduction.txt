Vine-Tongues: Introduction

So you want your own vine-tongue to tame and do your bidding? You have a tiny sprout and you need to know what to do next with your own little piece of shrubbery. Soon, with the help of my detailed instructions, you too will have a fully grown and tamed vine-tongue to bring joy into your life.

While savages like the Argonians of Murkmire may use these wonderful plants for barbaric means, I've learned how to train them to be something so much moreâ€”a true and faithful friend.

So follow my instructions, and remember, a vine-tongue isn't just part of your home. It's a part of your heart.
