Vine-Tongues: Preparations

When you're ready to bring a vine-tongue into your life, you must make sure that you're completely prepared. While these little vines of joy provide great happiness, they also demand lots of work and an extreme amount of patience!

Talk to your partner, your friends, and your family. Let them know what to expect ahead of time. Tell them to expect late-night feedings, constant soil changing, and the occasional blood ritual so they won't be alarmed or perturbed by the strange schedule.

Surprises can be fun, but the howling screams of a hungry vine-tongue breaking the silence of the middle of night can cause much consternation. So, prepare yourself, prepare your friends and family, and prepare your neighbors. A little inconvenience is a small price to pay for a lifetime of happiness!
