Warning from Fildgor

Kazok,

Although your troops may be tempted to sneak into Windhelm during the Konunleikar, you need to restrain them. 

I don't care how you do it, but other plans are in place within the city. If I find out that you or your soldiers disrupted anything, it will mean your head!

â€” Fildgor Orcthane
