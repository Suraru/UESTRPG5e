We Who Are About To Die

"We who are about to die—"

No, too direct. Too grim. How about ….

"We who are about to march to war—"

No, no. Too melodramatic. I need an opening for my memoir that's catchy, memorable, and will make people want to turn the pages. Let me see ….

"There once was a warrior from Rivenspire, who came to the Dragonstar Arena with a sword on fire—"

Now that's an opening! It even rhymes! I wonder how much of this I can write before it's our turn to enter the Arena? Ah, what's the hurry? I can always finish it after we win.
