What Comes Next

You won't regret your pledge to help. Together, we can reclaim Valenwood for the Bosmer!

If you're reading this, you should already have the requisite list of reagents and know what to do with them. When ready, seek a quiet corner of Grahtwood where you won't be disturbed. Perform the ritual when ready. It's simple—elegant. As Valenwood was before the Dominion polluted it.

Hircine will hear our call! The more who call out to him, the louder our voice. Together, we'll hunt—until all left in Valenwood are Bosmer.
