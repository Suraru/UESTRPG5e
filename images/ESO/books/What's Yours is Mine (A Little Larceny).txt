What's Yours is Mine (A Little Larceny)

What's mine is mine, what's yours is mine,
You turn your back and then
Your portable gear is gone from here
You never will see it again

Walker, don't get so attached
To objects and items material
You know that wisdom's found above
In the Moons and heavens ethereal
(Think fast!)

What's mine is mine, what's yours is mine,
You turn your back and then
Your portable gear is gone from here
You never will see it again

Faith in gold is sadly misplaced
True riches are friendship and love
Behold those dancers winking at you
You know what they're thinking of
(Look at that!)

What's mine is mine, what's yours is mine,
You turn your back and then
Your portable gear is gone from here
You never will see it again
