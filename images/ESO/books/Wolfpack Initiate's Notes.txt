Wolfpack Initiate's Notes

First day as a Wolfpack Initiate! We'll see how the bastards who mocked me at home feel when a feared bandit comes calling. I'm keeping my excitement restrained, because the senior members, the "Pack Leaders," are very stern and serious. I just like having a place where I belong.

Their obsession with wolves is strange, but … they take things seriously, and I respect that.
