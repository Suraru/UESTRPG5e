Word of Khiruna

I heard a cat meeting Khiruna's description was nabbed by the Guard for cutting purses in the market, after the Iron Wheel hit but before we were set up in <<c:1>>.

Word is, they were going to fine her and let her loose, but decided to turn her over to the Iron Wheel for more coin. (This is before the merchant lords decided <<2>> was bad for business.) Last I heard, she was loaded on a ship heading to <<3>>—nothing after that.
