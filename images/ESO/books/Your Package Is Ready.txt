Your Package Is Ready

Your package has been secured and your advance payment received. We're set. When you see the Rowdy Guar docked, meet me past midnight on the pier to take your delivery.

You'll be looking for a sealed barrel marked with a blue blaze on the staves. Place your bag of gold on top of the barrel where I can see it. That's when we'll make the exchange.

Once I count your gold, we tip the barrel on its side and you roll it right off the docks to your home, just like you'd do with apples or fish. I have an understanding with the dockmaster, so none of the Red Sails will stop you. If one does, just tell them you're delivering "mouse meat." They'll get the message.

If you're worried about any noise or shouting from inside the barrel, don't be. I'll take care of that before we land with a special potion of my own design. Your package will be absolutely quiet the whole way home, even if you roll and jostle it on the road. I'll give you another potion to counteract the first.

I'm certain you'll be more than satisfied with my delivery. But, whenever you get tired of this one, I can have you another in days, if you wish. There's always more where this came from, if you've got the gold.
