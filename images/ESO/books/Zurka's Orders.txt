Zurka's Orders

Cousin Zurka,

Those idiots at Mathiisen must be kept under surveillance. Right now their plans don't extend beyond Auridon, but if they do succeed in taking the island they could be trouble.

We're counting on you. Keep your claws sharp and your eyes open. 

Report any new developments to this one right away.
