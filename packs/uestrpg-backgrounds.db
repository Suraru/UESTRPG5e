Your fellow guild members will provide you with lodging and food if necessary, and pay for your funeral if needed. In some cities and towns, a guildhall offers a central place to meet other members of your profession, which can be a good place to meet potential patrons, allies, or hirelings.<br />    Guilds often wield tremendous political power. If you are accused of a crime, your guild will support you if a good case can be made for your innocence or the crime is justifiable. You can also gain access to powerful political figures through the guild, if you are a member in good standing. Such connections might require the donation of money or magic items to the guild’s coffers.<br />    You must pay dues of 20 septims per month to the guild. If you miss payments, you must make up back dues to remain in the guild’s good graces. </span></p>\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px\"> </p>\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"color:#8b0000\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">Guild artisans are among the most ordinary people in the world—until they set down their tools and take up an adventuring career.

The goals and philosophies of the order are more important than the gear and fighting style of its members, and so most of these orders aren't limited to fighting types, but are open to all sorts of folk who are willing to battle and die for the order's cause. </span></p>\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">    The \"Knightly Orders of Tamriel\" below details several of the orders that are active at present and is designed to help inform your decision about which group you owe allegiance to. </span></p>\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px\"> </p>\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Skill Proficiencies:</span> Persuasion, plus one from among Arcana, History, Nature, or Religion, as appropriate for your order.</span></p>\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Tool Proficiencies: </span>One type of gaming set or musical instrument</span></p>\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Languages: </span>One of your choice</span></p>\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Equipment: </span>One set of traveler's clothes, a signet, banner, or seal representing your place or rank in the order, and a pouch containing 40 septims.</span></p>\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px\"> </p>\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"color:#8b0000\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">FEATURE: KNIGHTLY REGARD</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">You receive shelter and succor from members of your knightly order and those who are sympathetic to its aims. If your order is a religious one, you can gain aid from temples and other religious communities of your deity. Knights of civic orders can get help from the community- whether a lone settlement or a great nation that they serve, and knights of philosophical orders can find help from those they have aided in pursuit of their ideals, and those who share those ideals. </span></p>\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">    This help comes in the form of shelter and meals, and healing when appropriate, as well as occasionally risky assistance, such as a band of local citizens rallying to aid a sorely pressed knight in a fight, or those who support the order helping to smuggle a knight out of town when he or she is being hunted unjustly.</span></p>\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px\"> </p>\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"color:#8b0000\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">KNIGHTLY ORDERS OF TAMRIEL</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">Many who rightfully call themselves \"knight\" earn that title as part of an order in service to a deity, such as the Vigil of Stendarr, or the Order of Arkay with their Knights of the Circle. Other knightly orders serve a government, royal family, or are the elite military of a feudal state, such as the Order of the Raven. Other knighthoods are secular and non governmental organizations of warriors who follow a particular philosophy, or consider themselves a kind of extended family, similar to an order of monks. Although there are organizations, such as the Order of the Lily, that use the trappings of knighthood without necessarily being warriors, most folk of Tamriel who hear the word \"knight\" think of a mounted warrior in armor beholden to a code. Below are a few knightly organizations. </span></p>\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">   <span style=\"font-style:italic\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"> Knights of the Dragon. </span></span>The Knights of the Dragon are the elite soldiers who are the official protectors of the city and royal family of Daggerfall. Sometimes they are confused as members of the Dragonguard, but they were not created to slay dragons. Their service is to His Majesty the Dragon, or rather, the current King or Queen of Daggerfall. Many knights are stationed in and around Daggerfall for protection of the crown, but many find themselves outside of High Rock, escorting nobles, or gathering information from their allies and enemies. These knights follow their oath: I vow to serve the Dragon. I lay down my life, my gold, and my sacred honor for my King. His word is my order, my sword is his arm.

Those who devote themselves to Anticlere and their blessed patrons are judged as worthy to join the order, and in return, the knights are treated as gods by the locals.</span></p>\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">    <span style=\"font-style:italic\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Knights of the Thorn.</span></span> The Knights of the Thorn are a chivalrous order dedicated to the protection of Cheydinhal, in Cyrodiil. Founded by Farwil Indarys, the group began as a glorified club, which spent more time drinking ale than they did doing anything else. However, shortly after their inception, tragedy came to the region and the Knights proved their worth, fending off several daedric invasions. The order's crest is a sword enveloped in thorns, a symbol of the Indarys family. Every member of the order wears a special medallion, or is outfitted in armor and weapons emblazoned with their coat-of-arms.</span></p>\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px\"> </p>\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"color:#8b0000\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">Use the tables for the soldier background in the <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Player's Handbook</span> as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a knight of your order. </span></p>\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">    Your bond almost always involves the order to which you belong (or at least key members of it), and it is highly unusual for a knight's ideal not to reflect the agenda, sentiment, or philosophy of one's order.</span></p>\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span class=\"wixGuard\">​</span></span></p>\n</div>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Background","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":null,"max":"","per":null},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"Knight of the Order","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"7p78eooyEyF8LXNq":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.g2nKGHpn3QjuAWwc"}},"_id":"OzqBx2ZTykAeTlEr"}

Becoming an adventurer doesn't necessarily require you to relinquish membership in your faction (though you can choose to do so), and it might enhance your status in the faction. </span></p>\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px\"> </p>\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Skill Proficiencies: </span>Insight and one Intelligence, Willpower, or Personality skill of your choice, as appropriate to your faction.</span></p>\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Languages: </span>Two of your choice</span></p>\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Equipment:</span> Badge or emblem of your faction, a copy of a seminal faction text (or a code-book for a covert faction), a set of common clothes, and a pouch containing 60 septims.</span></p>\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px\"> </p>\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"color:#8b0000\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">FACTIONS OF TAMRIEL</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">Tamriel is home to many factions, however, there are a handful of groups that have made a large impression on society. If your background is as an agent of one of the main factions of Tamriel, here are some possibilities. </span></p>\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">    <span style=\"font-style:italic\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">The Fighters Guild. </span></span>Found throughout most of Tamriel, The Fighter's Guild was founded in the 2nd era as an Akaviri-only organization, but has since opened up to all the races. The guild is a professional group, chartered by the Emperor, that regulates the hiring of mercenaries, protectors, and guards. Agents of the guild are often proficient in Athletics, and seek aid from other guild members, local guards, and members of the Imperial Legion. Operatives may find themselves ensuring other mercenary groups adhere to the law, or try to uncover corruption within the guild. </span></p>\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">    <span style=\"font-style:italic\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">The Mages Guild. </span></span>Although the traditional guild was </span></p>\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">dissolved in the 4th era, other groups of mages, such as the Synod and the College of Whispers have continued on the tradition of studying the mysteries and applications of magicka. Those who serve the Mages Guild are masters of Arcana, and seek assistance from scholars and sages. Operatives for the guild may be in search of powerful magical artifacts, or be watchful of wizards practicing forbidden magic.</span></p>\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">   <span style=\"font-style:italic\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"> The Thieves Guild. </span></span>Although thieves are criminals by definition, the guild is tolerated by local authorities for its role as a crime regulator. The guild prevents unregulated competition and does not allow egregious activities by its own members. Members are typically skilled at deception and other thieving skills. They seek aid from other mercenaries, wizards, and merchants allied with the Thieves Guild, and sometimes even the shadowy Dark Brotherhood.</span></p>\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">   <span style=\"font-style:italic\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"> The Imperial Legion.</span></span> Also known as the Imperial Army and the Ruby Ranks, the Legion is the main force of the Empire. Considered to be one of the best armies assembled in history, the Legion preserves peace and rule of law throughout the Empire. Members are required to be knowledgeable in Lore, and can always rely on the aid of governments that are part of the Empire, plus other leaders and groups who uphold the legions ideals.</span></p>\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">    <span style=\"font-style:italic\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">The Imperial Cult.</span></span> Worshipers of the Eight divines, they provide missionary work of their faith and bring divine inspiration and consolation across the Empire. Agents of the cult search out necromancers and daedra worshipers, and are usually skilled in Lore or Arcana. They seek aid from law enforcement friendly to the Empire, and clergy faithful to the Eight.</span></p>\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px\"> </p>\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"color:#8b0000\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">FEATURE: SAFE HAVEN</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">As a faction agent, you have access to a secret network of supporters and operatives who can provide assistance on your adventures. You know a set of secret signs and passwords you can use to identify such operatives, who can provide you with access to a hidden safe house, free room and board, or assistance in finding information. These agents never risk their lives for you or risk revealing their true identities. </span></p>\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"color:#8b0000\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><span class=\"wixGuard\">​</span></span></span></p>\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"color:#8b0000\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">Use the tables for the acolyte background in the <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Player's Handbook</span> as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a faction agent. (For instance, consider the words “faith” and “faction” to be interchangeable.)</span></p>\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">    Your bond might be associated with other members of your faction, or a location or an object that is important to your faction. The ideal you strive for is probably in keeping with the tenets and principles of your faction, but might be more personal in nature.</span></p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Background","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":null,"max":"","per":null},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"Faction Agent","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"7p78eooyEyF8LXNq":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.yD4b7E4WOrLvTmPs"}},"_id":"wDIfDLAKUQp1j9p2"}
