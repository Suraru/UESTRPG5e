The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind.</p>\n<p>While the effect is active, the frost shell has an AC of 10 and has 30 hit points. When the frost shell reaches 0 hit points, the shell breaks, ending the effect. A <a class=\"extiw\" title=\"dndbeyond:spells/dispel-magic\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dispel-magic\"><em>dispel magic</em></a> spell can also end the effects. The damage increases by 1d8 for each additional shout point you spend.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Kyne’s_Peace_(Kaan_Drem_Ov)\"></span><span id=\"Kyne.E2.80.99s_Peace_.28Kaan_Drem_Ov.29\" class=\"mw-headline\">Kyne’s Peace (Kaan Drem Ov)</span></h3>\n<p>As an action, you can spend 1 shout point to speak to a group of animals to soothe them. Each Beast that is within 60 feet of you and can hear you must make a Personality saving throw; a creature can choose to fail this saving throw if it wishes. If the creature fails the saving throw, any effect causing the target to be charmed or frightened ends, and the target becomes indifferent about any creatures of your choice that it is hostile toward. This indifference ends if the target is attacked or harmed by a spell or if it witnesses any of its allies being harmed. The creature becomes hostile again after 1 minute, unless the DM rules otherwise. The duration increases by 1 minute for each additional shout point you spend.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Marked_for_Death_(Krii_Lun_Aus)\"></span><span id=\"Marked_for_Death_.28Krii_Lun_Aus.29\" class=\"mw-headline\">Marked for Death (Krii Lun Aus)</span></h3>\n<p>As a bonus action, you can spend 1 shout point to mark a creature as though you cast the <a class=\"extiw\" title=\"dndbeyond:spells/hunters-mark\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/hunters-mark\"><em>hunter’s mark</em></a> spell at 1st level.

See this creature’s game statistics in the Valiant Warrior stat block (Enemies of Elsweyr), but you add your level to its hit points and half your proficiency bonus to its attack roll and damage roll.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Clear_Skies_(Lok_Vah_Koor)\"></span><span id=\"Clear_Skies_.28Lok_Vah_Koor.29\" class=\"mw-headline\">Clear Skies (Lok Vah Koor)</span></h3>\n<p>As an action, you can spend 1 shout point to use your voice to dispel any natural or magical inclement weather that you can see within 1 mile, forcing only clear skies to remain.

The range increases by a mile for each additional shout point you spend.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Cyclone_(Ven_Gar_Nos)\"></span><span id=\"Cyclone_.28Ven_Gar_Nos.29\" class=\"mw-headline\">Cyclone (Ven Gar Nos)</span></h3>\n<p><em>Prerequisite: 14th level</em><br />As an action, you can spend 4 shout points to create a whirling 5-foot radius cyclone that appears in a location within 60 feet of you that you can see. When the cyclone appears, each creature within 5 feet of it must make a Strength saving throw, taking 2d8 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful save. A creature must repeat this save when it comes within 5 feet of the cyclone for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.</p>\n<p>As a bonus action, you can move the cyclone up to 30 feet in any direction. The cyclone heavily obscures its area and sucks up any small materials, such as loose rocks, sand, or coins, within a 10-foot radius of it. The cyclone ends after one minute, if you end it as an action or if you are incapacitated.</p>\n<p>The damage increases by 1d8 for each additional shout point you spend.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Disarm_(Zun_Haal_Viik)\"></span><span id=\"Disarm_.28Zun_Haal_Viik.29\" class=\"mw-headline\">Disarm (Zun Haal Viik)</span></h3>\n<p><em>Prerequisite: 6th level</em><br />As an action, you use 2 shout points to create a shout that defies matter. One creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature drops one object of your choice it is holding in its hands and the object lands at a point of your choosing within 15 feet of the target. On a successful save, the creature continues to hold on to the objects in their hands, but they have disadvantage on any rolls made using the object, such as weapon attacks, until the end of their next turn.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Dismay_(Faas_Ru_Maar)\"></span><span id=\"Dismay_.28Faas_Ru_Maar.29\" class=\"mw-headline\">Dismay (Faas Ru Maar)</span></h3>\n<p><em>Prerequisite: 10th level</em><br />As an action, you can spend 2 shout points to speak a force of terror.

Additionally, each of your weapon attacks gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Elemental_Breath\" class=\"mw-headline\">Elemental Breath</span></h3>\n<p><em>Prerequisite: 6th level</em><br />You can spend 2 shout points to exhale an element of your choice. Choose either fire, cold or lightning. Each creature in a 15-foot cone must make an Agility saving throw. A creature takes 4d8 elemental damage on a failed save, and half as much on a successful one.

The damage increases by 1d8 and the size of its cone increases by 15 feet for each additional shout point you spend.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Elemental_Fury_(Su_Grah_Dun)\"></span><span id=\"Elemental_Fury_.28Su_Grah_Dun.29\" class=\"mw-headline\">Elemental Fury (Su Grah Dun)</span></h3>\n<p><em>Prerequisite: 11th level</em><br />As a bonus action, you spend 3 stamina points to imbue yourself with the speed of the wind. You cast the <a class=\"extiw\" title=\"dndbeyond:spells/haste\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/haste\"><em>haste</em></a> spell on yourself, but after the spell ends you do not experience a wave of lethargy.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Ice_Form_(Iiz_Slen_Nus)\"></span><span id=\"Ice_Form_.28Iiz_Slen_Nus.29\" class=\"mw-headline\">Ice Form (Iiz Slen Nus)</span></h3>\n<p><em>Prerequisite: 14th level</em><br />As an action, you can spend 4 shout points to freeze a creature. One creature of your choice that you can see within 90 feet of you must succeed on an Endurance saving throw or take 4d8 cold damage and be encased in a shell of ice. The encased creature is immobilized and can't speak, hear, move, or take any actions. The creature takes this damage again at the start of its turn while encased. The creature restrained by this spell must make another Endurance saving throw at the end of each of their turns to try and break free. If it successfully saves against this effect three times, the effect ends. If it fails its save three times, the frost hardens and the creature is subjected to the frozen condition. The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind.</p>\n<p>While the effect is active, the frost shell has an AC of 10 and has 30 hit points. When the frost shell reaches 0 hit points, the shell breaks, ending the effect. A <a class=\"extiw\" title=\"dndbeyond:spells/dispel-magic\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dispel-magic\"><em>dispel magic</em></a> spell can also end the effects. The damage increases by 1d8 for each additional shout point you spend.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Kyne’s_Peace_(Kaan_Drem_Ov)\"></span><span id=\"Kyne.E2.80.99s_Peace_.28Kaan_Drem_Ov.29\" class=\"mw-headline\">Kyne’s Peace (Kaan Drem Ov)</span></h3>\n<p>As an action, you can spend 1 shout point to speak to a group of animals to soothe them. Each Beast that is within 60 feet of you and can hear you must make a Personality saving throw; a creature can choose to fail this saving throw if it wishes. If the creature fails the saving throw, any effect causing the target to be charmed or frightened ends, and the target becomes indifferent about any creatures of your choice that it is hostile toward. This indifference ends if the target is attacked or harmed by a spell or if it witnesses any of its allies being harmed. The creature becomes hostile again after 1 minute, unless the DM rules otherwise. The duration increases by 1 minute for each additional shout point you spend.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Marked_for_Death_(Krii_Lun_Aus)\"></span><span id=\"Marked_for_Death_.28Krii_Lun_Aus.29\" class=\"mw-headline\">Marked for Death (Krii Lun Aus)</span></h3>\n<p>As a bonus action, you can spend 1 shout point to mark a creature as though you cast the <a class=\"extiw\" title=\"dndbeyond:spells/hunters-mark\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/hunters-mark\"><em>hunter’s mark</em></a> spell at 1st level.

To cast one of your crusader spells of 1st level and higher, you must expend magicka points, as noted in the spell's description and the Magicka Cost table found in chapter 10 of the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Basic Rules\" href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/Basic_Rules\"><em>Basic Rules</em></a>.

When you do so, choose a number of crusader spells equal to your Personality modifier + half your crusader level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you can cast, as shown on the Spell Level column of the Crusader table.</p>\n<p>For example, if you are a 5th-level crusader, you can cast a prepared spell at either 1st or 2nd level. With a Personality of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <a class=\"extiw\" title=\"dndbeyond:spells/cure-wounds\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/cure-wounds\"><em>cure wounds</em></a>, you can cast it at either 1st or 2nd level.

Once you use this feature in this way, you can’t use it again until you finish a short rest.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"LGtC pg 13","activation":{"type":"action","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":10,"units":"minute"},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":"self"},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":"self"},"uses":{"value":1,"max":"1","per":"lr"},"consume":{"type":"","target":"","amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"Path of the Wilds 3","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"effects":[{"_id":"OYXupkMqgSnudMa9","changes":[{"key":"StatusEffect","mode":0,"value":"Convenient Effect: Invisible","priority":"20"}],"disabled":false,"duration":{"rounds":600,"startTime":null},"icon":"modules/uestrpg5e/artwork/ESO/ability/Guild/fightersguild/001_b.png","label":"Camouflaged","origin":"Item.ojU5vjBCjSKVNfyV","transfer":false,"flags":{"core":{"statusId":""},"dae":{"stackable":"none","durationExpression":"","macroRepeat":"none","specialDuration":["1Attack"],"transfer":false}},"tint":null,"selectedKey":"StatusEffect"}],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"7p78eooyEyF8LXNq":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.ojU5vjBCjSKVNfyV"},"cf":{"id":"temp_2ups0zogf9i"}}}
