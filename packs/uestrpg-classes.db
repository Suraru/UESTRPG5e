With a weapon in one hand and a spell in the other, spellswords should never be underestimated.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Prized_Fighters_and_Mercenaries\" class=\"mw-headline\">Prized Fighters and Mercenaries</span></h2>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Nimbler and more athletic than a mage, with spell-casting more versatile than a warrior, spellswords are powerful and unpredictable fighters. Many spellswords start their careers as mercenaries or join militias or the Imperial Legion.</p>\n<p>Through vigorous training, spellswords learn how to wield any blade and create a unique bond with their favored weapons. Beyond their martial prowess, spellswords rely on magic to augment their skills and become superior combatants on the battlefield.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Disciplined_and_Versitle\" class=\"mw-headline\">Disciplined and Versitle</span></h2>\n<p>Not everyone trained in combat and magic can be considered a spellsword. Only those who have mastered how to weave magic into their weapons and dedicate themselves to their craft can truly be considered a spellsword. Likewise, not all spellswords are equal. Some devote themselves to protecting others, some favor magic, while others prefer the blade.</p>\n<p>As adventurers, many spellswords start out as treasure hunters, soldiers of fortune, and mercenaries. Many spellswords take up a life of adventuring to continue their training or search for a greater fortune.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Creating_a_Spellsword\" class=\"mw-headline\">Creating a Spellsword</span></h2>\n<p>As you build your spellsword, consider a couple of elements of your character's training: where did you receive your combat training? Were you evenly focused on martial and magical skills, or did you favor one over the other. Did you dedicate your skills on destruction or on the protection of others? Did you get extra help from a mentor? Did your training come from joining the military or were you self taught to protect your homeland.</p>\n<p>Where did you learn your magical skill? Was it passed down from a family tradition or did you learn through vigorous study in college? Did you learn magic before you learned how to fight? Or did you pick up magic as a way to set you apart from the other troops.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Spellsword_Class_Table\" class=\"mw-headline\">Spellsword Class Table</span></h3>\n<h3><span id=\"Spellsword_Class_Table\" class=\"mw-headline\"></span></h3>\n<table class=\"uestrpgtable\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Level</th>\n<th>Proficiency Bonus</th>\n<th>Features</th>\n<th>Imbue Magic Die</th>\n<th>Cantrips Known</th>\n<th>Spells Known</th>\n<th>Magicka</th>\n<th>Spell Level</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Spellsword#Imbue_Elements\">Imbue Elements</a>, <a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Spellsword#Weapon_Bond\">Weapon Bond</a></td>\n<td>1d4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Spellsword#Spellcasting\">Spellcasting</a></td>\n<td>1d4</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>1st</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Spellsword#Mystic_Path\">Mystic Path</a></td>\n<td>1d4</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>1st</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Spellsword#Attribute_Score_Improvement\">Attribute Score Improvement </a></td>\n<td>1d4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>1st</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Spellsword#Extra_Attack\">Extra Attack</a></td>\n<td>1d6</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>2nd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Spellsword#Mystic_Path\">Mystic Path Feature</a></td>\n<td>1d6</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>2nd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Spellsword#Spell_Weaving\">Spell Weaving</a></td>\n<td>1d6</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>2nd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Spellsword#Attribute_Score_Improvement\">Attribute Score Improvement </a></td>\n<td>1d6</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>22</td>\n<td>2nd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>1d8</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>27</td>\n<td>3rd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Spellsword#Reliable_Knowledge\">Reliable Knowledge</a></td>\n<td>1d8</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>30</td>\n<td>3rd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Spellsword#Eldritch_Strike\">Eldritch Strike</a></td>\n<td>1d8</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>32</td>\n<td>3rd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Spellsword#Attribute_Score_Improvement\">Attribute Score Improvement </a></td>\n<td>1d8</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>35</td>\n<td>3rd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>1d10</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>38</td>\n<td>4th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Spellsword#Mystic_Path\">Mystic Path Feature</a></td>\n<td>1d10</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>40</td>\n<td>4th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Spellsword#Arcane_Might\">Arcane Might</a></td>\n<td>1d10</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>44</td>\n<td>4th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Spellsword#Attribute_Score_Improvement\">Attribute Score Improvement </a></td>\n<td>1d10</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>50</td>\n<td>4th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>+6</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>1d12</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>57</td>\n<td>5th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>+6</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Spellsword#Improved_Spell_Weaving\">Improved Spell Weaving</a></td>\n<td>1d12</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>60</td>\n<td>5th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>+6</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Spellsword#Attribute_Score_Improvement\">Attribute Score Improvement </a></td>\n<td>1d12</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>64</td>\n<td>5th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>+6</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Spellsword#Mystic_Path\">Mystic Path Feature</a></td>\n<td>1d12</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>64</td>\n<td>5th</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3><span id=\"Quick_Build\" class=\"mw-headline\">Quick Build</span></h3>\n<p>You can make a spellsword quickly by following these suggestions.

These magic-users are dedicated to the study of the dark arts, learning their spells through focused study, ensuring they've selected the right tools to hone their craft.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"The_Balance_of_Life_and_Death\" class=\"mw-headline\">The Balance of Life and Death</span></h2>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Necromancy is about the creative manipulation of the soul, or animus, one of the basic building blocks of life on Tamriel. Necromancers use this power to cast spells, bind souls into service, and use lesser Daedric spirits to reanimate corpses. While the Mage's Guild may consider necromancy to be its own distinct school of magic, other scholars have put into question this categorization.</p>\n<p>Many necromancers will argue that the magic they practice is nearly indistinguishable from other schools, arguing that it's just an offshoot of mysticism, conjuration, and enchantment—no more dangerous than fireballs and scrying spells. How a necromancer chooses to wield their power over the animus makes a significant different in how their individual art is perceived. In some cases, the magic is nearly a mirror of the restoration spells used by priests in a temple.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Practiced_in_Secret\" class=\"mw-headline\">Practiced in Secret</span></h2>\n<p>The practice of necromancy is frowned upon in most cultures and is often seen as a taboo subject throughout much of Tamriel. Certain cultures view necromancy as the ultimate blasphemy, especially the Redguard, who find the entire practice to be utterly abhorrent. The Dunmer see necromancy as profane, yet their tradition of ancestral conjuration might be seen as hypocritical by outsiders. Even those that are willing to embrace it often do so with trepidation.</p>\n<p>Necromantic acts are illegal in many places, and there might be repercussions if the wrong person discovers the truth behind a necromancers magic. While there are many spells from this school of magic that are indiscernible from restoration, there are also many acts that are blatantly necromantic, such as raising bodies out of the ground. Unless a necromancer is certain that the people they are around will accept their magical gift, they are likely to keep the true nature of their magic hidden.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Creating_a_Necromancer\" class=\"mw-headline\">Creating a Necromancer</span></h2>\n<p>Creating a necromancer requires you to consider your character’s moral outlook on necromancy. How does your character view necromancy as a school of magic? Do you have any objections to reanimating the dead or do you view a corpse simply as a vessel that can be utilized? Do you prefer to avoid the more controversial magic or do you embrace the school fully?</p>\n<p>What was the lure that brought you into the dark arts? Did you have a teacher in your college that introduced you to the prohibited magic, or was its banned nature what led you to seek out the knowledge in secret? Perhaps you felt wronged by the relentless circle of life and you have sought out the means to defy it.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Necromancer_Class_Table\" class=\"mw-headline\">Necromancer Class Table</span></h3>\n<h3><span id=\"Necromancer_Class_Table\" class=\"mw-headline\"></span></h3>\n<table class=\"uestrpgtable\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Level</th>\n<th>Proficiency<br />Bonus</th>\n<th>Features</th>\n<th>Cantrips<br />Known</th>\n<th>Spells<br />Known</th>\n<th>Magicka</th>\n<th>Spell<br />Level</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/EoE:Necromancer#Spellcasting\">Spellcasting</a>, <a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/EoE:Necromancer#Death_Gleaning\">Death Gleaning</a></td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>1st</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/EoE:Necromancer#Necromantic_Art\">Necromantic Art</a>, <a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/EoE:Necromancer#Soul_Harvest\">Soul Harvest</a></td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>1st</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/EoE:Necromancer#Soul_Strike\">Soul Strike</a></td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>2nd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/EoE:Necromancer#Attribute_Score_Improvement\">Attribute Score Improvement </a></td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>2nd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>27</td>\n<td>3rd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/EoE:Necromancer#Necromantic_Art\">Necromantic Art Feature</a></td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>32</td>\n<td>3rd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>38</td>\n<td>4th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/EoE:Necromancer#Attribute_Score_Improvement\">Attribute Score Improvement </a></td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>44</td>\n<td>4th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>57</td>\n<td>5th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/EoE:Necromancer#Inured_to_Undeath\">Inured to Undeath</a></td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>64</td>\n<td>5th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>73</td>\n<td>6th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/EoE:Necromancer#Attribute_Score_Improvement\">Attribute Score Improvement </a></td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>73</td>\n<td>6th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>83</td>\n<td>7th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/EoE:Necromancer#Necromantic_Art\">Necromantic Art Feature</a></td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>83</td>\n<td>7th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>94</td>\n<td>8th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/EoE:Necromancer#Attribute_Score_Improvement\">Attribute Score Improvement </a></td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>94</td>\n<td>8th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>+6</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/EoE:Necromancer#Transcendence\">Transcendence</a></td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>107</td>\n<td>9th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>+6</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/EoE:Necromancer#Necromantic_Art\">Necromantic Art Feature</a></td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>114</td>\n<td>9th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>+6</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/EoE:Necromancer#Attribute_Score_Improvement\">Attribute Score Improvement </a></td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>123</td>\n<td>9th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>+6</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/EoE:Necromancer#Reanimate\">Reanimate</a></td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>133</td>\n<td>9th</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3><span id=\"Quick_Build\" class=\"mw-headline\">Quick Build</span></h3>\n<p>You can make a necromancer quickly by following these suggestions.

Divine radiance shines from her hands, the man’s wounds knit closed, and his eyes open wide with amazement.</p>\n<p>A Dunmer crouches behind an outcrop, his black cloak making him nearly invisible in the night, and watches a goblin war band celebrating its recent victory. Silently, he stalks into their midst and whispers an oath, and two goblins are dead before they even realize he is there. Silver hair shining in a shaft of light that seems to illuminate only him, an Altmer laughs with exultation. His spear flashes like his eyes as he jabs again and again at a twisted giant, until at last his light overcomes its hideous darkness.</p>\n<p>Whatever their origin and their mission, <strong>crusaders</strong> are united by their devotion to stand against the forces of evil. Whether sworn before a Divine’s altar and the witness of a priest, in a castle before a sovereign king, or in a moment of desperation and grief with the dead as the only witness, a crusader's devotion is a powerful bond. It is a source of power that turns a devout warrior into a blessed champion.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"The_Cause_of_Righteousness\" class=\"mw-headline\">The Cause of Righteousness</span></h2>\n<p>A crusader swears to uphold justice and righteousness, to stand with the good things of the world against the encroaching darkness, and to hunt the forces of evil wherever they lurk. Different crusaders focus on various aspects of the cause of righteousness, but all are bound by the devotions that grant them power to do their sacred work. Although many crusaders are devoted to gods of good, a crusader’s power comes as much from a commitment to justice itself as it does from a god.</p>\n<p>Crusaders train for years to learn the skills of combat, mastering a variety of weapons and armor. Even so, their martial skills are secondary to the magical power they wield: power to heal the sick and injured, to smite the wicked and the undead, and to protect the innocent and those who join them in the fight for justice.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Beyond_the_Mundane_Life\" class=\"mw-headline\">Beyond the Mundane Life</span></h2>\n<p>Almost by definition, the life of a crusader is an adventuring life. Unless a lasting injury has taken them away from adventuring for a time, every crusader lives on the front lines of the cosmic struggle against evil. Warriors are rare enough among the ranks of the militias and armies of the world, but even fewer people can claim the true calling of a crusader. When they do receive the call, these champions turn from their former occupations and take up arms to fight evil. Sometimes their devotions lead them into the service of a sovereign as leaders of elite groups of knights, but even then their loyalty is first to the cause of righteousness, not to crown or province.</p>\n<p>Adventuring crusaders take their work seriously. A delve into an ancient ruin or dusty crypt can be a quest driven by a higher purpose than the acquisition of treasure. Evil lurks in dungeons and primeval forests, and even the smallest victory against it can tilt the cosmic balance away from Oblivion.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Creating_a_Crusader\" class=\"mw-headline\">Creating a Crusader</span></h2>\n<p>The most important aspect of a crusader character is the nature of their holy quest. Although the class features related to your devotion don't appear until you reach 3rd level, plan ahead for that choice by reading the devotion descriptions at the end of the class. Are you a devoted servant of good, loyal to the gods of justice and honor, a holy knight in shining armor venturing forth to smite evil? Are you a glorious champion of the light, cherishing everything beautiful that stands against the shadow, a knight whose devotion descends from traditions older than many of the gods? Or are you an embittered loner sworn to take vengeance on those who have done great evil, sent as an angel of death by the gods or driven by your need for revenge?</p>\n<p>How did you experience your call to serve as a crusader? Did you hear a whisper from an unseen god while you were at prayer? Did another crusader sense the potential within you and decide to train you as a squire? Or did some terrible event—the destruction of your home, perhaps—drive you to your quests? Perhaps you stumbled into a sacred grove or a hidden enclave and found yourself called to protect all such refuges of goodness and beauty. Or you might have known from your earliest memories that the crusader’s life was your calling, almost as if you had been sent into the world with that purpose stamped on your soul.</p>\n<p>As guardians against the forces of wickedness, crusaders are rarely of any evil alignment. Most of them walk the paths of charity and justice. Consider how your alignment colors the way you pursue your holy quest and the manner in which you conduct yourself before gods and mortals. Your devotion and alignment might be in harmony, or your devotion might represent standards of behavior you have not yet attained.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Crusader_Class_Table\" class=\"mw-headline\">Crusader Class Table</span></h3>\n<h3><span id=\"Crusader_Class_Table\" class=\"mw-headline\"></span></h3>\n<table class=\"uestrpgtable\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Level</th>\n<th>Proficiency Bonus</th>\n<th>Features</th>\n<th>Magicka</th>\n<th>Spell Level</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Crusader#Divine_Sense\">Divine Sense</a>, <a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Crusader#Lay_on_Hands\">Lay on Hands</a></td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Crusader#Fighting_Style\">Fighting Style</a>, <a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Crusader#Spellcasting\">Spellcasting</a>, <a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Crusader#Divine_Smite\">Divine Smite</a></td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>1st</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Crusader#Divine_Health\">Divine Health</a>, <a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Crusader#Devotion\">Devotion</a></td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>1st</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Crusader#Attribute_Score_Improvement\">Attribute Score Improvement </a></td>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>1st</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Crusader#Extra_Attack\">Extra Attack</a></td>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>2nd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Crusader#Aura_of_Protection\">Aura of Protection</a></td>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>2nd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Crusader#Devotion\">Devotion Feature</a></td>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>2nd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Crusader#Attribute_Score_Improvement\">Attribute Score Improvement </a></td>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>2nd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>22</td>\n<td>3rd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Crusader#Aura_of_Courage\">Aura of Courage</a></td>\n<td>27</td>\n<td>3rd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Crusader#_Improved_Divine_Smite\">Improved Divine Smite</a></td>\n<td>30</td>\n<td>3rd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Crusader#Attribute_Score_Improvement\">Attribute Score Improvement </a></td>\n<td>35</td>\n<td>3rd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>38</td>\n<td>4th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Crusader#Cleansing_Touch\">Cleansing Touch</a></td>\n<td>40</td>\n<td>4th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Crusader#Devotion\">Devotion Feature</a></td>\n<td>44</td>\n<td>4th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Crusader#Attribute_Score_Improvement\">Attribute Score Improvement </a></td>\n<td>50</td>\n<td>4th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>+6</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>57</td>\n<td>5th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>+6</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Crusader#Aura_Improvements\">Aura Improvements</a></td>\n<td>60</td>\n<td>5th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>+6</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Crusader#Attribute_Score_Improvement\">Attribute Score Improvement </a></td>\n<td>64</td>\n<td>5th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>+6</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Crusader#Devotion\">Devotion Feature</a></td>\n<td>64</td>\n<td>5th</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3><span id=\"Quick_Build\" class=\"mw-headline\">Quick Build</span></h3>\n<p>You can make a crusader quickly by following these suggestions.

To cast one of your crusader spells of 1st level and higher, you must expend magicka points, as noted in the spell's description and the Magicka Cost table found in chapter 10 of the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Basic Rules\" href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/Basic_Rules\"><em>Basic Rules</em></a>. You regain all expended magicka points when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p>You prepare the list of crusader spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the <a title=\"BR:Crusader Spells\" href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Crusader_Spells\">crusader spell list</a>. When you do so, choose a number of crusader spells equal to your Personality modifier + half your crusader level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you can cast, as shown on the Spell Level column of the Crusader table.</p>\n<p>For example, if you are a 5th-level crusader, you can cast a prepared spell at either 1st or 2nd level. With a Personality of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <a class=\"extiw\" title=\"dndbeyond:spells/cure-wounds\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/cure-wounds\"><em>cure wounds</em></a>, you can cast it at either 1st or 2nd level. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\n<p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of crusader spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Spellcasting_Attribute\" class=\"mw-headline\">Spellcasting Attribute</span></h3>\n<p>Personality is your spellcasting ability for your crusader spells, since their power derives from the strength of your convictions.

Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a crusader to transgress his or her devotion. A crusader who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a <a title=\"BR:Priest\" href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Priest\">priest</a> who shares his or her faith or from another crusader of the same order. The crusader might spend an all-night vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self-denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the crusader starts fresh. If a crusader willfully violates his or her devotion and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the GM’s discretion, an impenitent crusader might be forced to abandon this class and adopt another, or perhaps to take the <a title=\"PT:Blackguard\" href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/PT:Blackguard\">Blackguard</a> crusader option.</p>\n<table class=\"mw-collapsible mw-made-collapsible\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th> </th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>\n<h3><span id=\"Blackguard\" class=\"mw-headline\">Blackguard</span></h3>\n</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a title=\"PT:Blackguard\" href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/PT:Blackguard\">Blackguards</a> are <a class=\"mw-selflink selflink\">crusaders</a> who care only for their own power and survival.

More than a mere emotion, their anger is the ferocity of a cornered predator, the unrelenting assault of a storm, the churning turmoil of the sea. For some, their rage springs from a connection with ancient traditions. Others draw from a roiling reservoir of anger from memories of past battles. For every barbarian, rage is a power that fuels not just a battle frenzy but also uncanny reflexes, resilience, and feats of strength.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Primal_Instinct\" class=\"mw-headline\">Primal Instinct</span></h2>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>People of towns and cities take pride in how their civilized ways set them apart from animals, as if denying one’s own nature was a mark of superiority. To a barbarian, though, civilization is no virtue, but a sign of weakness. The strong embrace their animal nature-keen instincts, primal physicality, and ferocious rage. Barbarians are uncomfortable when hedged in by walls and crowds. They thrive in the wilds of their homelands: the desert, tundra, jungle, or grasslands where their tribes live and hunt. Barbarians come alive in the chaos of combat. They can enter a berserk state where rage takes over, giving them superhuman strength and resilience. A barbarian can draw on this reservoir of fury only a few times without resting, but those few rages are usually sufficient to defeat whatever threats arise.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Life_of_Danger\" class=\"mw-headline\">Life of Danger</span></h2>\n<p>Not every member of the tribes deemed “barbarians” by scions of civilized society has the barbarian class. A true barbarian among these people is as uncommon as a skilled fighter in a town, and he or she plays a similar role as a protector of the people and a leader in times of war. Life in the wild places of the world is fraught with peril: rival tribes, deadly weather, and terrifying monsters. Barbarians charge headlong into that danger so that their people don’t have to.</p>\n<p>Their courage in the face of danger makes barbarians perfectly suited for adventuring. Wandering is often a way of life for their native tribes, and the rootless life of the adventurer is little hardship for a barbarian. Some barbarians miss the close-knit family structures of the tribe, but eventually find them replaced by the bonds formed among the members of their adventuring parties.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Creating_a_Barbarian\" class=\"mw-headline\">Creating a Barbarian</span></h2>\n<p>When creating a barbarian character, think about where your character comes from and their place in the world. Talk with your DM about an appropriate origin for your barbarian. Did you come from a distant land, making you a stranger in the area of the campaign? Or is the campaign set in a rough-and- tumble frontier where barbarians are common?</p>\n<p>What led you to take up the adventuring life? Were you lured to settled lands by the promise of riches? Did you join forces with soldiers of those lands to face a shared threat? Did monsters or an invading horde drive you out of your homeland, making you a rootless refugee? Perhaps you were a prisoner of war, brought in chains to “civilized” lands and only now able to win your freedom.

This cantrip doesn't count against your number of cantrips known.

You gain darkvision and can see in dim light within 120 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light.

When you are in dim light or darkness, as a bonus action you can teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see that is also in dim light or darkness. Additionally, you can teleport into a shadow cast by another creature within range when you are not in dim light or darkness. You then have advantage on the first melee attack you make before the end of your turn.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Magical_Ambush\" class=\"mw-headline\">Magical Ambush</span></h3>\n<p>At 9th level, if you are hidden from a creature when you cast a spell on it, the creature has disadvantage on any saving throw it makes against the spell this turn.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Night_Magic\" class=\"mw-headline\">Night Magic</span></h3>\n<p>At 11th level, your continued research in the esoteric studies of shadow magic has unlocked an arcane secret known as night magic. Choose one 6th-level spell from the nightblade spell list. You can cast this unique spell once without expending any magicka. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again.</p>\n<p>At higher levels, you gain more nightblade spells of your choice that can be cast in this way: one 7th-level spell at 13th level, one 8th-level spell at 15th level, and one 9th-level spell at 17th level. You regain all uses of your Night Magic spells when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Versatile_Trickster\" class=\"mw-headline\">Versatile Trickster</span></h3>\n<p>At 13th level, you gain the ability to distract targets with your <a class=\"extiw\" title=\"dndbeyond:spells/mage-hand\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/mage-hand\"><em>mage hand</em></a>. As a bonus action on your turn, you can designate a creature within 5 feet of the spectral hand created by the spell. Doing so gives you advantage on attack rolls against that creature until the end of the turn.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Spell_Thief\" class=\"mw-headline\">Spell Thief</span></h3>\n<p>At 18th level, you gain the ability to magically steal the knowledge of how to cast a spell from another spellcaster.</p>\n<p>Immediately after a creature casts a spell that targets you or includes you in its area of effect, you can use your reaction to force the creature to make a saving throw with it's spellcasting attribute modifier. The DC equals your spell save DC. On a failed save, you negate the spell effect against you, and you steal the knowledge of the spell if it is at least 1st level and of a level that you can cast (it doesn't need to be a nightblade spell). For the next 8 hours, you know the spell and can cast it, using magicka as normal. The creature can't cast that spell until 8 hours have passed.</p>\n<p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Shade\" class=\"mw-headline\">Shade</span></h3>\n<p>When you reach 20th level, you have mastered the dark arts of shadow magic, allowing you to call into the shadow realms and bring forth your own shadow. As a bonus action on your turn, you can summon a shadowy version of yourself which appears from your shadow. This creature shares all of your statistics, including your current hit points, and is wearing the same equipment as you. The shade can communicate with you telepathically, knows everything that you know, and shares your alignment, background, and motivations. The shade disappears when it drops to 0 hit points, or you use a bonus action to dismiss it back to the shadow realm.</p>\n<p>As a part of your turn, you can direct the shade to move a distance equal to your speed. You can also direct the shade to make one weapon attack.</p>\n<p>Additionally, as a bonus action on your turn, you can swap places with your shade, as long as you are within 60 feet of each other. Once you use this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Path_of_Darkness_2\" class=\"mw-headline\">Path of Darkness</span></h2>\n<p>At 1st level, a nightblade gains the Path of Darkness feature, which offers the choice of a subclass.

Whether channeled as a striking display of combat prowess or a subtler focus of defensive ability and speed, this energy infuses all that a monk does.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"The_Magic_of_Stamina\" class=\"mw-headline\">The Magic of Stamina</span></h2>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Monks make careful study of a magical energy that most monastic traditions call stamina. This energy is an element of the magic that suffuses the Mundas – specifically, the element that flows through living bodies. Monks harness this power within themselves to create magical effects and exceed their bodies' physical capabilities, and some of their special attacks can hinder the flow of stamina in their opponents. Using this energy, monks channel uncanny speed and strength into their unarmed strikes. As they gain experience, their martial training and their mastery of stamina gives them more power over their bodies and the bodies of their foes.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Training_and_Asceticism\" class=\"mw-headline\">Training and Asceticism</span></h2>\n<p>Small walled cloisters dot the landscapes of Tamriel, tiny refuges from the flow of ordinary life, where time seems to stand still. The monks who live there seek personal perfection through contemplation and rigorous training. Many entered the monastery as children, sent to live there when their parents died, when food couldn’t be found to support them, or in return for some kindness that the monks had performed for their families.</p>\n<p>Some monks live entirely apart from the surrounding population, secluded from anything that might impede their spiritual progress. Others are sworn to isolation, emerging only to serve as spies or assassins at the command of their leader, a noble patron, or some other mortal or divine power.</p>\n<p>The majority of monks don’t shun their neighbors, making frequent visits to nearby towns or villages and exchanging their service for food and other goods. As versatile warriors, monks often end up protecting their neighbors from monsters or tyrants.</p>\n<p>For a monk, becoming an adventurer means leaving a structured, communal lifestyle to become a wanderer. This can be a harsh transition, and monks don’t undertake it lightly. Those who leave their cloisters take their work seriously, approaching their adventures as personal tests of their physical and spiritual growth. As a rule, monks care little for material wealth and are driven by a desire to accomplish a greater mission than merely slaying monsters and plundering their treasure.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Creating_a_Monk\" class=\"mw-headline\">Creating a Monk</span></h2>\n<p>As you make your monk character, think about your connection to the monastery where you learned your skills and spent your formative years. Were you an orphan or a child left on the monastery’s threshold? Did your parents promise you to the monastery in gratitude for a service performed by the monks? Did you enter this secluded life to hide from a crime you committed? Or did you choose the monastic life for yourself?</p>\n<p>Consider why you left. Did the head of your monastery choose you for a particularly important mission beyond the cloister? Perhaps you were cast out because of some violation of the community’s rules. Did you dread leaving, or were you happy to go? Is there something you hope to accomplish outside the monastery? Are you eager to return to your home?</p>\n<p>As a result of the structured life of a monastic community and the discipline required to harness stamina, monks are almost always lawful in alignment.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Monk_Class_Table\" class=\"mw-headline\">Monk Class Table</span></h3>\n<table class=\"uestrpgtable\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Level</th>\n<th>Proficiency<br

You start knowing three such features: <strong>Flurry of Blows</strong>, <strong>Patient Defense</strong>, and <strong>Step of the Wind</strong>. You learn more stamina features as you gain levels in this class.</p>\n<p>When you spend a stamina point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended stamina back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your stamina points.</p>\n<p>Some of your stamina features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>\n<dl>\n<dd><strong>Stamina save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Willpower modifier</dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n<h4><span id=\"Flurry_of_Blows\" class=\"mw-headline\">Flurry of Blows</span></h4>\n<p>Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 stamina point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action.</p>\n<h4><span id=\"Patient_Defense\" class=\"mw-headline\">Patient Defense</span></h4>\n<p>You can spend 1 stamina point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your turn.</p>\n<h4><span id=\"Step_of_the_Wind\" class=\"mw-headline\">Step of the Wind</span></h4>\n<p>You can spend 1 stamina point to take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus action on your turn, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Unarmored_Movement\" class=\"mw-headline\">Unarmored Movement</span></h3>\n<p>Starting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield.

A blow that is concentrated into a small point becomes more potent.

The orc nearby shouts orders, helping the two combatants coordinate their assault to the best advantage.</p>\n<p>A Nord in chain mail interposes his shield between the ogre’s club and his companion, knocking the deadly blow aside. His companion, a Dunmer in scale armor, swings two scimitars in a blinding whirl as she circles the ogre, looking for a blind spot in its defense.</p>\n<p>A gladiator fights for sport in an arena, a master with his trident and net, skilled at toppling foes and moving them around for the crowd’s delight – and his own tactical advantage. His opponent’s sword flares with red light an instant before she sends flames flashing forth to smite him.</p>\n<p>All of these heroes are <a class=\"mw-selflink selflink\">warriors</a>, perhaps the most diverse class of characters in the world of Tamriel. Questing knights, conquering overlords, royal champions, elite foot soldiers, hardened mercenaries, and bandit kings – as warriors, they all share an unparalleled mastery with weapons and armor, and a thorough knowledge of the skills of combat. And they are well acquainted with death, both meting it out and staring it defiantly in the face.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Well-Rounded_Specialists\" class=\"mw-headline\">Well-Rounded Specialists</span></h2>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Warriors learn the basics of all combat styles. Every warrior can swing an axe, fence with a rapier, wield a longsword or a greatsword, use a bow, and even trap foes in a net with some degree of skill. Likewise, a warrior is adept with shields and every form of armor. Beyond that basic degree of familiarity, each warrior specializes in a certain style of combat. Some concentrate on archery, some on fighting with two weapons at once, and some on augmenting their martial skills with magic. This combination of broad general ability and extensive specialization makes warriors superior combatants on battlefields and in dungeons alike.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Trained_for_Danger\" class=\"mw-headline\">Trained for Danger</span></h2>\n<p>Not every member of the city watch, the village militia, or the queen’s army is a warrior. Most of these troops are relatively untrained soldiers with only the most basic combat knowledge. Veteran soldiers, military officers, trained bodyguards, dedicated knights, and similar figures are warriors.</p>\n<p>Some warriors feel drawn to use their training as adventurers. The dungeon delving, monster slaying, and other dangerous work common among adventurers is second nature for a warrior, not all that different from the life he or she left behind. There are greater risks, perhaps, but also much greater rewards – few warriors in the city watch have the opportunity to discover a magic flame tongue sword, for example.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Creating_a_Warrior\" class=\"mw-headline\">Creating a Warrior</span></h2>\n<p>As you build your warrior, think about two related elements of your character's background: Where did you get your combat training, and what set you apart from the mundane warriors around you? Were you particularly ruthless? Did you get extra help from a mentor, perhaps because of your exceptional dedication? What drove you to this training in the first place? A threat to your homeland, a thirst for revenge, or a need to prove yourself might all have been factors.</p>\n<p>You might have enjoyed formal training in a noble’s army or in a local militia. Perhaps you trained in a war academy, learning strategy, tactics, and military history. Or you might be self-taught – unpolished but well tested. Did you take up the sword as a way to escape the limits of life on a farm, or are you following a proud family tradition? Where did you acquire your weapons and armor? They might have been military issue or family heirlooms, or perhaps you scrimped and saved for years to buy them. Your armaments are now among your most important possessions—the only things that stand between you and death’s embrace.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Warrior_Class_Table\" class=\"mw-headline\">Warrior Class Table</span></h3>\n<h3><span id=\"Warrior_Class_Table\" class=\"mw-headline\"></span></h3>\n<table class=\"uestrpgtable\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Level</th>\n<th>Proficiency Bonus</th>\n<th>Features</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Warrior#Warrior_Style\">Warrior Style</a>, <a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Warrior#Second_Wind\">Second Wind</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Warrior#Action_Surge\">Action Surge</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Warrior#Warrior_Archetype\">Warrior Archetype</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Warrior#Attribute_Score_Improvement\">Attribute Score Improvement </a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Warrior#Extra_Attack\">Extra Attack</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Warrior#Attribute_Score_Improvement\">Attribute Score Improvement </a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Warrior#Warrior_Archetype\">Warrior Archetype Feature</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Warrior#Attribute_Score_Improvement\">Attribute Score Improvement </a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Warrior#Indomitable\">Indomitable</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Warrior#Warrior_Archetype\">Warrior Archetype Feature</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Warrior#Extra_Attack\">Extra Attack (2)</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Warrior#Attribute_Score_Improvement\">Attribute Score Improvement </a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Warrior#Indomitable\">Indomitable (2 uses)</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Warrior#Attribute_Score_Improvement\">Attribute Score Improvement </a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Warrior#Warrior_Archetype\">Warrior Archetype Feature</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Warrior#Attribute_Score_Improvement\">Attribute Score Improvement </a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>+6</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Warrior#Action_Surge\">Action Surge (2 uses)</a>, <a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Warrior#Indomitable\">Indomitable (3 uses)</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>+6</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Warrior#Warrior_Archetype\">Warrior Archetype Feature</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>+6</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Warrior#Attribute_Score_Improvement\">Attribute Score Improvement </a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>+6</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Warrior#Extra_Attack\">Extra Attack (3)</a></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3><span id=\"Quick_Build\" class=\"mw-headline\">Quick Build</span></h3>\n<p>You can make a warrior quickly by following these suggestions.

One can’t study sorcery as one learns a language, any more than one can learn to live a legendary life. No one chooses sorcery; the power chooses the sorcerer.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Raw_Magic\" class=\"mw-headline\">Raw Magic</span></h2>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Magic is a part of every sorcerer, suffusing body, mind, and spirit with a latent power that waits to be tapped. Some sorcerers wield magic that springs from an ancient bloodline, while others have made a dangerous pact with powerful beings to grant them unimaginable power.</p>\n<p>The appearance of sorcerous powers is wildly unpredictable. Some ancestries produce exactly one sorcerer in every generation, but in other lines of descent every individual is a sorcerer. Most of the time, the talents of sorcery appear from the alignment of the stars. Some sorcerers can’t name the origin of their power, while others trace it to strange events in their own lives. The touch of a daedra or a taste of the water from a mysterious spring might spark the gift of sorcery. So too might the gift of a deity, exposure to the elemental forces of the Mundus or the maddening chaos of Oblivion.</p>\n<p>Sorcerers don't rely on spellbooks and ancient tomes of magic lore the way that mages do. By learning to harness and channel their own inborn magic, they can discover new and staggering ways to unleash that power.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Unexplained_Powers\" class=\"mw-headline\">Unexplained Powers</span></h2>\n<p>Sorcerers are rare in the world, and it’s unusual to find a sorcerer who is not involved in the adventuring life in some way. People with magical power seething in their veins soon discover that the power doesn’t like to stay quiet. A sorcerer’s magic wants to be wielded.</p>\n<p>Sorcerers often have obscure or quixotic motivations driving them to adventure. Some seek a greater understanding of the magical force that infuses them, or the answer to the mystery of its origin. Others hope to find a way to get rid of it, or to unleash its full potential. Whatever their goals, sorcerers are every bit as useful to an adventuring party as mages, making up for a comparative lack of breadth in their magical knowledge with enormous capacity and power in using the spells they know.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Creating_a_Sorcerer\" class=\"mw-headline\">Creating a Sorcerer</span></h2>\n<p>The most important question to consider when creating your sorcerer is the focus of your power. As a starting character, you'll choose a focus that ties to either your ancestry, your birthright, an unexpected event, or to daedric influence, but the exact source of your power is up to you to decide. Is it a family curse, passed down to you from distant ancestors? Or did some extraordinary event leave you blessed with inherent magic but perhaps scarred as well?</p>\n<p>How do you feel about the magical power coursing through you? Do you embrace it, try to master it, or revel in its nature? Is it a blessing or a curse? Did you seek it out, or did it find you? Did you have the option to refuse it, and do you wish you had? What do you intend to do with it? Perhaps you feel like you’ve been given this power for some lofty purpose. Or you might decide that the power gives you the right to do what you want, to take what you want from those who lack such power. Perhaps your power links you to a powerful individual in the world – the deity that blessed you at birth or the daedra who chose you to carry this power.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Sorcerer_Class_Table\" class=\"mw-headline\">Sorcerer Class Table</span></h3>\n<h3><span id=\"Sorcerer_Class_Table\" class=\"mw-headline\"></span></h3>\n<table class=\"uestrpgtable\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Level</th>\n<th>Proficiency Bonus</th>\n<th>Features</th>\n<th>Cantrips Known</th>\n<th>Spells Known</th>\n<th>Magicka</th>\n<th>Bonus Sorcery Magicka</th>\n<th>Spell Level</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Sorcerer#Spellcasting\">Spellcasting</a>, <a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Sorcerer#Sorcery_Focus\">Sorcery Focus</a></td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1st</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Sorcerer#Capacitor\">Capacitor</a></td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1st</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Sorcerer#Power_Overwhelming\">Power Overwhelming</a></td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2nd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Sorcerer#Attribute_Score_Improvement\">Attribute Score Improvement </a></td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>2nd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>27</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3rd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Sorcerer#Sorcery_Focus\">Sorcery Focus Feature</a></td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>32</td>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>3rd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>38</td>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>4th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Sorcerer#Attribute_Score_Improvement\">Attribute Score Improvement </a></td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>44</td>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>4th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>57</td>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>5th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Sorcerer#Equilibrium\">Equilibrium</a></td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>64</td>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>5th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>73</td>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>6th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Sorcerer#Attribute_Score_Improvement\">Attribute Score Improvement </a></td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>73</td>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>6th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>83</td>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>7th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Sorcerer#Sorcery_Focus\">Sorcery Focus Feature</a></td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>83</td>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>7th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>94</td>\n<td>23</td>\n<td>8th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Sorcerer#Attribute_Score_Improvement\">Attribute Score Improvement </a></td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>94</td>\n<td>23</td>\n<td>8th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>+6</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>107</td>\n<td>26</td>\n<td>9th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>+6</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Sorcerer#Sorcery_Focus\">Sorcery Focus Feature</a></td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>114</td>\n<td>28</td>\n<td>9th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>+6</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Sorcerer#Attribute_Score_Improvement\">Attribute Score Improvement </a></td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>123</td>\n<td>30</td>\n<td>9th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>+6</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Sorcerer#Sorcerous_Restoration\">Sorcerous Restoration</a></td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>133</td>\n<td>33</td>\n<td>9th</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3><span id=\"Quick_Build\" class=\"mw-headline\">Quick Build</span></h3>\n<p>You can make a sorcerer quickly by following these suggestions.

Preferring to use their charisma to diffuse confrontations, they can also rely on their quick thinking to avoid harm, and are not afraid to engage in hand-to-hand combat. They excel at picking locks and avoiding traps, which makes them a valuable asset to any adventuring party.</p>\n<p>When a thief is forced into combat, they excel in one-on-one battles, or strike and retreat tactics. Thieves have an almost supernatural knack for avoiding danger, and choose patience to slowly wear their opponent down, rather than beat them into submission.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"A_Livelihood_of_Infamy\" class=\"mw-headline\">A Livelihood of Infamy</span></h2>\n<p>Thieves are a common in any settlement. Some thieves work on their own, but the most successful join thieves' guilds for the extra opportunities and protection. They can find themselves making a living as simple cutpurses, acting as simple beggars and acrobats, or as dangerous burglars and enforcers. Those that find solace on the seas dedicate their lives to piracy and romantic flings in various port cities, or become deadly marauders, pillaging the less protected villages on the outskirts of society.</p>\n<p>Although not necessarily on the side of the law, many thieves and guilds team up with local law enforcement, creating an unspoken allegiance to regulate crime. Other thieves might prefer to use their particular skills to become locksmiths, or like to think of themselves as professional treasure hunters, explorers, or investigators.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Creating_a_Thief\" class=\"mw-headline\">Creating a Thief</span></h2>\n<p>As you create your thief character, consider what you did in the past that allowed you to hone your skills. Do you have a criminal past – or present? Are you on the run from the law or from an angry thieves’ guild master? Or did you leave your guild in search of bigger risks and bigger rewards? Is it greed that drives you in your adventures, or some other desire or ideal?</p>\n<p>What was the trigger that led you away from your previous life? Did a great con or heist gone terribly wrong cause you to reevaluate your career? Maybe you were lucky and a successful robbery gave you the coin you needed to escape the squalor of your life. Did wanderlust finally call you away from your home? Perhaps you suddenly found yourself cut off from your family or your mentor, and you had to find a new means of support. Or maybe you made a new friend another member of your adventuring party – who showed you new possibilities for earning a living and employing your particular talents.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Thief_Class_Table\" class=\"mw-headline\">Thief Class Table</span></h3>\n<h3><span id=\"Thief_Class_Table\" class=\"mw-headline\"></span></h3>\n<table class=\"uestrpgtable\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Level</th>\n<th>Proficiency Bonus</th>\n<th>Features</th>\n<th>Sneak Attack</th>\n<th>Exceptional Speed</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Thief#Exceptional_Speed\">Exceptional Speed</a>, <a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Thief#Legerdemain\">Legerdemain</a>, <a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Thief#Sneak_Attack\">Sneak Attack</a></td>\n<td>1d6</td>\n<td>+5 ft.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Thief#Cunning_Action\">Cunning Action</a></td>\n<td>1d6</td>\n<td>+5 ft.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Thief#Thieves_Archetype\">Thieves Archetype</a></td>\n<td>2d6</td>\n<td>+5 ft.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Thief#Attribute_Score_Improvement\">Attribute Score Improvement</a>, <a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Thief#Slowfall\">Slowfall</a></td>\n<td>2d6</td>\n<td>+5 ft.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Thief#Uncanny_Dodge\">Uncanny Dodge</a></td>\n<td>3d6</td>\n<td>+5 ft.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Thief#Treasure_Hunter\">Treasure Hunter</a></td>\n<td>3d6</td>\n<td>+10 ft.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Thief#Evasion\">Evasion</a></td>\n<td>4d6</td>\n<td>+10 ft.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Thief#Attribute_Score_Improvement\">Attribute Score Improvement</a></td>\n<td>4d6</td>\n<td>+10 ft.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Thief#Thieves_Archetype\">Thieves Archetype Feature</a></td>\n<td>5d6</td>\n<td>+10 ft.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Thief#Muffled_Movement\">Muffled Movement</a></td>\n<td>5d6</td>\n<td>+10 ft.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Thief#Distraction\">Distraction</a></td>\n<td>6d6</td>\n<td>+15 ft.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Thief#Attribute_Score_Improvement\">Attribute Score Improvement</a></td>\n<td>6d6</td>\n<td>+15 ft.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Thief#Thieves_Archetype\">Thieves Archetype Feature</a></td>\n<td>7d6</td>\n<td>+15 ft.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Thief#Cunning_Manipulator\">Cunning Manipulator</a></td>\n<td>7d6</td>\n<td>+15 ft.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Thief#Blindsense\">Blindsense</a></td>\n<td>8d6</td>\n<td>+15 ft.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Thief#Attribute_Score_Improvement\">Attribute Score Improvement</a></td>\n<td>8d6</td>\n<td>+20 ft.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>+6</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Thief#Thieves_Archetype\">Thieves Archetype Feature</a></td>\n<td>9d6</td>\n<td>+20 ft.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>+6</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Thief#Elusive\">Elusive</a></td>\n<td>9d6</td>\n<td>+20 ft.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>+6</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Thief#Attribute_Score_Improvement\">Attribute Score Improvement</a></td>\n<td>10d6</td>\n<td>+20 ft.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>+6</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Thief#Thief.E2.80.99s_Reflexes\">Thief’s Reflexes</a></td>\n<td>10d6</td>\n<td>+20 ft.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3><span id=\"Quick_Build\" class=\"mw-headline\">Quick Build</span></h3>\n<p>You can make a thief quickly by following these suggestions.

His companion attacks and within seconds, the formidable construct is laid to waste.</p>\n<p>An Imperial lurks in the shadows of an alley while his accomplice prepares for her part in the ambush. When their target – a notorious slaver – passes the alleyway, the accomplice cries out, the slaver comes to investigate, and the assassin’s blade cuts his throat before he can make a sound.</p>\n<p>Shifting her gaze between the bandit's hands and his stance, a Dunmer realizes that negotiations have broken down. Darting out of the way from the bandit's sudden movement, she is able to avoid the blow while simultaneously disarming him with a few quick jabs to the kidneys.</p>\n<p><a class=\"mw-selflink selflink\">Rogues</a> rely on skill, stealth, and finding their foes weak points to get the upper hand in any situation. They have a knack for finding the solution to just about any problem, demonstrating a resourcefulness and versatility that is the cornerstone of any successful adventuring party.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Skill_and_Precision\" class=\"mw-headline\">Skill and Precision</span></h2>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Rogues devote as much effort to mastering the use of a variety of skills as they do to perfecting their combat abilities, giving them a broad expertise that few other characters can match. Many rogues focus on stealth and deception, while others refine the skills that help them in a dungeon environment, such as climbing, finding and disarming traps, and opening locks.</p>\n<p>When it comes to combat, rogues prioritize cunning over brute strength. A rogue would rather make one precise strike, placing it exactly where the attack will hurt the target most, then wear an opponent down with a barrage of attacks.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"A_Covert_Living\" class=\"mw-headline\">A Covert Living</span></h2>\n<p>Every town and city has its share of rogues. Many of them live up to the worst stereotypes of the class, making a living as blackguards, operatives, spies, and assassins, Often, these scoundrels team up with thieves guilds or noble families. Plenty of rogues operate independently, but even they sometimes recruit apprentices to help them in their investigations and interrogations. A few rogues make an honest living as locksmiths, investigators, or exterminators, which can be a dangerous job in a world where skeevers – and wererats – haunt the sewers.</p>\n<p>As adventurers, rogues fall on both sides of the law. Some are vagabonds that live for the thrill of uncovering lost secrets, while others take up a life of adventure after being sponsored by noble families. Some have learned and perfected their skills with the explicit purpose of infiltrating ancient ruins and hidden crypts in search of treasure.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Creating_a_Rogue\" class=\"mw-headline\">Creating a Rogue</span></h2>\n<p>As you create your rogue character, consider the character’s relationship to the law. Did you work alongside inspectors and the guard or did you find yourself working as an operative in the thieves guild? Have you changed your stance on your profession, possibly angering local law makers or guild masters? Did you leave to find independent work on your own, in search of bigger risks and bigger rewards? Is it greed that drives you in your adventures, or some other desire or ideal?</p>\n<p>What was the trigger that led you away from your previous life? Did you learn undisclosed information then you weren't expected to? Maybe you were able to break a secret code that led you to a stash of riches to help you start a new life. Did wanderlust finally call you away from your home? Perhaps you suddenly found yourself cut off from your family or your mentor, and you had to find a new means of support. Or maybe you made a new friend another member of your adventuring party – who showed you new possibilities for earning a living and employing your particular talents.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Rogue_Class_Table\" class=\"mw-headline\">Rogue Class Table</span></h3>\n<h3><span id=\"Rogue_Class_Table\" class=\"mw-headline\"></span></h3>\n<table class=\"uestrpgtable\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Level</th>\n<th>Proficiency Bonus</th>\n<th>Features</th>\n<th>Precision Dice</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Rogue#Expertise\">Expertise</a>, <a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Rogue#Precise_Attacks\">Precise Attacks</a></td>\n<td>1d4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Rogue#Strategic_Aid\">Strategic Aid</a></td>\n<td>1d4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Rogue#Roguish_Archetype\">Roguish Archetype</a>, <a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Rogue#Tactical_Avoidance\">Tactical Avoidance</a></td>\n<td>1d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Rogue#Attribute_Score_Improvement\">Attribute Score Improvement </a></td>\n<td>1d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Rogue#Extra_Attack\">Extra Attack</a></td>\n<td>1d8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Rogue#Expertise_Improvement\">Expertise Improvement</a></td>\n<td>1d8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Rogue#Quick_Thinking\">Quick Thinking</a></td>\n<td>1d10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Rogue#Attribute_Score_Improvement\">Attribute Score Improvement </a></td>\n<td>1d10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Rogue#Roguish_Archetype_Feature\">Roguish Archetype Feature</a></td>\n<td>2d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Rogue#Attribute_Score_Improvement\">Attribute Score Improvement</a></td>\n<td>2d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Rogue#Advanced_Maneuvers\">Advanced Maneuvers</a></td>\n<td>2d8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Rogue#Attribute_Score_Improvement\">Attribute Score Improvement </a></td>\n<td>2d8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Rogue#Roguish_Archetype_Feature\">Roguish Archetype Feature</a></td>\n<td>2d10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Rogue#Mental_Agility\">Mental Agility</a></td>\n<td>2d10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Rogue#Slippery_Mind\">Slippery Mind</a></td>\n<td>3d8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Rogue#Attribute_Score_Improvement\">Attribute Score Improvement </a></td>\n<td>3d8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>+6</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Rogue#Roguish_Archetype_Feature\">Roguish Archetype Feature</a></td>\n<td>3d10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>+6</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Rogue#Solo_Artist\">Solo Artist</a></td>\n<td>3d10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>+6</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Rogue#Attribute_Score_Improvement\">Attribute Score Improvement </a></td>\n<td>3d10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>+6</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Rogue#Stroke_of_Luck\">Stroke of Luck</a></td>\n<td>3d10</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3><span id=\"Quick_Build\" class=\"mw-headline\">Quick Build</span></h3>\n<p>You can make a rogue quickly by following these suggestions.

Whispering instructions in Yoku, he points to the bear he’s been tracking and sends the hawk to distract the creature while he readies his bow.</p>\n<p>Far from the bustle of cities and towns, past the hedges that shelter the most distant farms from the terrors of the wild, amid the dense-packed trees of trackless forests and across wide and empty plains, <a class=\"mw-selflink selflink\">rangers</a> keep their unending watch.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Deadly_Hunters\" class=\"mw-headline\">Deadly Hunters</span></h2>\n<p>Warriors of the wilderness, rangers specialize in hunting the monsters that threaten the edges of civilization—humanoid raiders, rampaging beasts, terrible giants, and deadly dragons. They learn to track their quarry as a predator does, moving stealthily through the wilds and hiding themselves in brush and rubble. Rangers focus their combat training on techniques that are particularly useful against their specific favored foes. A ranger’s talents and abilities are honed with deadly focus on the grim task of protecting the borderlands.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Independent_Adventurers\" class=\"mw-headline\">Independent Adventurers</span></h2>\n<p>Though a ranger might make a living as a hunter, a guide, or a tracker, a ranger’s true calling is to defend the outskirts of civilization from the ravages of monsters and humanoid hordes that press in from the wild. In some places, rangers gather in secretive orders or join forces with warden conclaves. Many rangers, though, are independent almost to a fault, knowing that, when a dragon or a band of goblins attacks, a ranger might be the first—and possibly the last line of defense.</p>\n<p>This fierce independence makes rangers well suited to adventuring, since they are accustomed to life far from the comforts of a dry bed and a hot bath. Faced with city-bred adventurers who grouse and whine about the hardships of the wild, rangers respond with some mixture of amusement, frustration, and compassion. But they quickly learn that other adventurers who can carry their own weight in a fight against civilization’s foes are worth any extra burden. Coddled city folk might not know how to feed themselves or find fresh water in the wild, but they make up for it in other ways.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Creating_a_Ranger\" class=\"mw-headline\">Creating a Ranger</span></h2>\n<p>As you create your ranger character, consider the nature of the training that gave you your particular capabilities. Did you train with a single mentor, wandering the wilds together until you mastered the ranger’s ways? Did you leave your apprenticeship, or was your mentor slain—perhaps by the same kind of monster that became your favored enemy? Or perhaps you learned your skills as part of a band of rangers affiliated with a warden conclave, trained in mystic paths as well as wilderness lore. You might be self-taught, a recluse who learned combat skills, tracking, and have a connection to nature through the necessity of surviving in the wilds.</p>\n<p>What’s the source of your particular hatred of a certain kind of enemy? Did a monster kill someone you loved or destroy your home village? Or did you see too much of the destruction these monsters cause and commit yourself to reining in their depredations? Is your adventuring career a continuation of your work in protecting the borderlands, or a significant change? What made you join up with a band of adventurers? Do you find it challenging to teach new allies the ways of the wild, or do you welcome the relief from solitude that they offer?</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Ranger_Class_Table\" class=\"mw-headline\">Ranger Class Table</span></h3>\n<h3><span id=\"Ranger_Class_Table\" class=\"mw-headline\"></span></h3>\n<table class=\"uestrpgtable\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Level</th>\n<th>Proficiency<br />Bonus</th>\n<th>Features</th>\n<th>Techniques<br />Known</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Ranger#Favored_Enemy\">Favored Enemy</a>, <a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Ranger#Natural_Explorer\">Natural Explorer</a></td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Ranger#Fighting_Style\">Fighting Style</a>, <a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Ranger#Wild_Technique\">Wild Techniques</a></td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Ranger#Primal_Instincts\">Primal Instincts</a>, <a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Ranger#_Ranger_Archetype\"> Ranger Archetype</a></td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Ranger#Attribute_Score_Improvement\">Attribute Score Improvement</a></td>\n<td>3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Ranger#Extra_Attack\">Extra Attack</a></td>\n<td>3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Ranger#Adaptive_Hunter\">Adaptive Hunter</a>, <a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Ranger#Favored_Enemy\">Favored Enemy</a>, <a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Ranger#Natural_Explorer\">Natural Explorer Improvements</a></td>\n<td>4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Ranger#Primal_Defense\"> Primal Defense</a>, <a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Ranger#Ranger_Archetype\"> Ranger Archetype Feature</a></td>\n<td>5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Ranger#Attribute_Score_Improvement\">Attribute Score Improvement</a>, <a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Ranger#Land.E2.80.99s_Stride\">Land’s Stride</a></td>\n<td>5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Ranger#Skirmisher.E2.80.99s_Stealth\">Skirmisher’s Stealth</a></td>\n<td>6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Ranger#Natural_Explorer\">Natural Explorer Improvement</a>, <a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Ranger#Hide_in_Plain_Sight\">Hide in Plain Sight</a></td>\n<td>6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Ranger#_Ranger_Archetype\"> Ranger Archetype Feature</a></td>\n<td>7</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Ranger#Attribute_Score_Improvement\">Attribute Score Improvement</a></td>\n<td>7</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Ranger#Nature.E2.80.99s_Protection\">Nature’s Protection</a></td>\n<td>8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Ranger#Favored_Enemy\">Favored Enemy Improvement</a>, <a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Ranger#Vanish\">Vanish</a></td>\n<td>8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Ranger#_Ranger_Archetype\"> Ranger Archetype Feature</a></td>\n<td>9</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Ranger#Attribute_Score_Improvement\">Attribute Score Improvement</a></td>\n<td>9</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>+6</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Ranger#Primal_Connection\">Primal Connection</a></td>\n<td>10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>+6</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Ranger#Feral_Senses\">Feral Senses</a></td>\n<td>10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>+6</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Ranger#Attribute_Score_Improvement\">Attribute Score Improvement</a></td>\n<td>11</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>+6</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Ranger#Foe_Slayer\">Foe Slayer</a></td>\n<td>11</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3><span id=\"Quick_Build\" class=\"mw-headline\">Quick Build</span></h3>\n<p>You can make a ranger quickly by following these suggestions.

They are friendly to you and your comrades, and you roll initiative for the called creatures as a group, which takes its own turns. The GM has the creatures’ statistics.</p>\n<p>After 1 hour, these beasts return to their previous location. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again in the same general area for 24 hours, as the same animals will not repeatedly heed your call.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Danger_Sense\" class=\"mw-headline\">Danger Sense</span></h3>\n<p>You have advantage on initiative rolls as long as you aren’t incapacitated.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Elusive_Escape\" class=\"mw-headline\">Elusive Escape</span></h3>\n<p><em>Prerequisite: 4th level</em></p>\n<p>You can move up to half your speed as a reaction when an enemy moves within 5 feet of you.

Whispering instruction in Yoku, he points to the river troll he's been tracking and sends the bear to distract the troll while he readies a powerful spell.</p>\n<p>Swinging a mace formed by pure ice, an Argonian charges into a mass of skeletal soldiers, sundering the unnatural magic that gives the foul creatures the mocking semblance of life.</p>\n<p>Crouching out of sight on a high tree branch in the form of a leopard, a Bosmer peers out of the jungle at the strange construction of the daedric temple, keeping an eye on cultists' activities.</p>\n<p>Whether calling on the elemental forces of nature or emulating the creatures of the animal world, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Warden\" href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/Warden\">Wardens</a> are an embodiment of nature's resilience, cunning, and fury. They claim no mastery over nature. Instead, they see themselves as extensions of nature's indomitable will.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Guardians_of_Nature\" class=\"mw-headline\">Guardians of Nature</span></h2>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Wardens are stalwart protectors who draw on the primal spirits of nature to defend the natural world. They revere nature above all, gaining their spells and other magical powers from the forces of nature or from their connection with Y'ffre, the deity of song and forest. Drawing upon the natural environment, wardens are able to shape and change reality itself.</p>\n<p>Wardens are willing to shed blood to protect the wilds, attacking individuals, gangs, and entire outposts that have done harm to Y'ffre's realm. While warden spells are oriented towards nature and animals, how they choose to use this power is up to them. Some fight side by side with animal companions, overwhelming their enemies with the intensity of tooth and claw. Others call on the aspects of nature, harnessing the preservative and devastating powers of the seasons, or becoming like the forest itself. Some wardens even gain the ability to take on animal forms, even to the point where they prefer their animal form to their natural form.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Protecting_the_Balance\" class=\"mw-headline\">Protecting the Balance</span></h2>\n<p>For wardens, nature exists in a precarious balance. They understand their role to protect the natural world can take many forms, many of which seem to contradict one another. Wardens consider anyone who seeks out to corrupt or destroy nature as enemies, yet they accept that which is cruel in nature.</p>\n<p>Wardens are also concerned with the delicate ecological balance that sustains plant and animal life, and the need for civilized folk to live in harmony with nature, not in opposition to it. While they are guardians and protectors, they appreciate that conservation requires both the preservation of natures gifts, as well as the culling of its own kind to keep the balance intact. Sometimes protection includes stepping in when nature seeks to consume itself. Unlike the Bosmer followers of Y'ffre, wardens are willing to make full use of nature's bounty in order to survive.</p>\n<p>Wardens are warriors on Nature's behalf and exist throughout Tamriel. They hate that which is unnatural, including fiends (such as the daedra) and the undead (such as zombies and vampires). Wardens are often found guarding sacred sites or watching over regions of unspoiled nature. But when a significant danger arises, threatening nature's balance or the lands they protect, wardens take on a more active role in combating the threat, as adventurers.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Creating_a_Warden\" class=\"mw-headline\">Creating a Warden</span></h2>\n<p>When making a warden, consider why your character has such a close bond with nature. Perhaps your character had a dramatic encounter with a tremendous seasonal storm, struck by lightning or nearly frozen by a blizzard, and survived the experience. Maybe your character was raised by nature – taken in by a bear and raised as though one of her cubs, or you character was abandoned in the depths of a forest to be nurtured by spriggans. Perhaps your character is a staunch defender of a barbarian tribe, chosen by the spirits of nature as part of your character's destiny to protect your people.</p>\n<p>Have you always been an adventurer, or did you first spent time as a caretaker of a sacred grove or spring? Perhaps your homeland was befouled by evil, and you took up an adventuring life in hopes of protecting the homelands of others.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Warden_Class_Table\" class=\"mw-headline\">Warden Class Table</span></h3>\n<h3><span id=\"Warden_Class_Table\" class=\"mw-headline\"></span></h3>\n<table class=\"uestrpgtable\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Level</th>\n<th>Proficiency Bonus</th>\n<th>Features</th>\n<th>Cantrips Known</th>\n<th>Magicka</th>\n<th>Spell Level</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Warden#Spellcasting\">Spellcasting</a></td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>1st</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Warden#Mark_of_Balance\">Mark of Balance</a>, <a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Warden#Warden_Conclave\">Warden Conclave</a></td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>1st</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>2nd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Warden#Attribute_Score_Improvement\">Attribute Score Improvement </a></td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>2nd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>27</td>\n<td>3rd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Warden#Warden_Conclave\">Warden Conclave Feature</a></td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>32</td>\n<td>3rd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>38</td>\n<td>4th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Warden#Attribute_Score_Improvement\">Attribute Score Improvement </a></td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>44</td>\n<td>4th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>57</td>\n<td>5th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Warden#Warden_Conclave\">Warden Conclave Feature</a></td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>64</td>\n<td>5th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>73</td>\n<td>6th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Warden#Attribute_Score_Improvement\">Attribute Score Improvement </a></td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>73</td>\n<td>6th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>83</td>\n<td>7th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Warden#Warden_Conclave\">Warden Conclave Feature</a></td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>83</td>\n<td>7th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>94</td>\n<td>8th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Warden#Attribute_Score_Improvement\">Attribute Score Improvement </a></td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>94</td>\n<td>8th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>+6</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>107</td>\n<td>9th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>+6</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Warden#Timeless_Body\">Timeless Body</a>, <a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Warden#Mark_of_Harmony\">Mark of Harmony</a></td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>114</td>\n<td>9th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>+6</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Warden#Attribute_Score_Improvement\">Attribute Score Improvement </a></td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>123</td>\n<td>9th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>+6</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Warden#Archwarden\">Archwarden</a></td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>133</td>\n<td>9th</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3><span id=\"Quick_Build\" class=\"mw-headline\">Quick Build</span></h3>\n<p>You can make a warden quickly by following these suggestions.

The bard is a master of song, speech, and the magic they contain. Bards say that the Mundus was spoken into existence, that the words of the et’Ada gave it shape, and that echoes of these primordial Words of Creation still resound throughout both Aetherius and Oblivion. The music of bards is an attempt to snatch and harness those echoes, subtly woven into their spells and powers.</p>\n<p>The greatest strength of bards is their sheer versatility. Many bards prefer to stick to the sidelines in combat, using their magic to inspire their allies and hinder their foes from a distance. But bards are capable of defending themselves in melee if necessary, using their magic to bolster their swords and armor. Their spells lean toward charms and illusions rather than blatantly destructive spells. They have a wide-ranging knowledge of many subjects and a natural aptitude that lets them do almost anything well. Bards become masters of the talents they set their minds to perfecting, from musical performance to esoteric knowledge.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Learning_from_Experience\" class=\"mw-headline\">Learning from Experience</span></h2>\n<p>True bards are not common in Tamriel. Not every minstrel singing in a tavern or jester cavorting in a royal court is a bard. Discovering the magic hidden in music requires hard study and some measure of natural talent that most troubadours and jongleurs lack. It can be hard to spot the difference between these performers and true bards, though. A bard’s life is spent wandering across the land gathering lore, telling stories, and living on the gratitude of audiences, much like any other entertainer. But a depth of knowledge, a level of musical skill, and a touch of magic set bards apart from their fellows.</p>\n<p>Only rarely do bards settle in one place for long, and their natural desire to travel—to find new tales to tell, new skills to learn, and new discoveries beyond the horizon—makes an adventuring career a natural calling. Every adventure is an opportunity to learn, practice a variety of skills, enter long-forgotten tombs, discover lost works of magic, decipher old tomes, travel to strange places, or encounter exotic creatures. Bards love to accompany heroes to witness their deeds firsthand. A bard who can tell an awe-inspiring story from personal experience earns renown among other bards. Indeed, after telling so many stories about heroes accomplishing mighty deeds, many bards take these themes to heart and assume heroic roles themselves.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Creating_a_Bard\" class=\"mw-headline\">Creating a Bard</span></h2>\n<p>Bards thrive on stories, whether those stories are true or not. Your character’s background and motivations are not as important as the stories that he or she tells about them. Perhaps you had a secure and mundane childhood. There’s no good story to be told about that, so you might paint yourself as an orphan raised by a hag in a dismal swamp. Or your childhood might be worthy of a story. Some bards acquire their magical music through extraordinary means, including the inspiration of fey or other supernatural creatures.</p>\n<p>Did you serve an apprenticeship, studying under a master, following the more experienced bard until you were ready to strike out on your own? Or did you attend a college where you studied bardic lore and practiced your musical magic? Perhaps you were a young runaway or orphan, befriended by a wandering bard who became your mentor. Or you might have been a spoiled noble child tutored by a master. Perhaps you stumbled into the clutches of a hag, making a bargain for a musical gift in addition to your life and freedom, but at what cost?</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Bard_Class_Table\"

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell <a class=\"extiw\" title=\"dndbeyond:spells/cure-wounds\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/cure-wounds\"><em>cure wounds</em></a> and have a spell level of 2nd, you can use magicka to cast <a class=\"extiw\" title=\"dndbeyond:spells/cure-wounds\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/cure-wounds\"><em>cure wounds</em></a> at either level.</p>\n<div class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">See also: <a class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Spellcasting\" href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/Spellcasting\">Spellcasting</a></div>\n<h4><span id=\"Spells_Known_of_1st_Level_and_Higher\" class=\"mw-headline\">Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</span></h4>\n<p>At first level, you know four 1st-level spells of your choice from the <a title=\"BR:Bard Spells\" href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Bard_Spells\">bard spell list</a>.</p>\n<p>The Spells Known column of the <a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Bard#Bard_Class_Table\">Bard table</a> shows when you learn more bard spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you can cast, as shown on the table's Spell Level column for your bard level. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>\n<p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the bard spells you know and replace it with another spell from the <a title=\"BR:Bard Spells\" href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Bard_Spells\">bard spell list</a>, which also must be of a level that you can cast.</p>\n<p>Whenever you finish a long rest, you can replace one spell you learned from this Spellcasting feature with another spell from the <a title=\"BR:Bard Spells\" href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Bard_Spells\">bard spell list</a>. The new spell must be the same level as the spell you replace.</p>\n<h4><span id=\"Spellcasting_Attribute\" class=\"mw-headline\">Spellcasting Attribute</span></h4>\n<p>Personality is your spellcasting attribute for your bard spells. Your magic comes from the heart and soul you pour into the performance of your music or oration. You use your Personality whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting attribute. In addition, you use your Personality modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a bard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>\n<dl>\n<dd><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Personality modifier</dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dd>\n<dl>\n<dd><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Personality modifier</dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n<h4><span id=\"Ritual_Casting\" class=\"mw-headline\">Ritual Casting</span></h4>\n<p>You can cast any bard spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Bardic_Inspiration\" class=\"mw-headline\">Bardic Inspiration</span></h3>\n<p>You can inspire others through your stirring words or music. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature, other than yourself, within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a d6.</p>\n<p>Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.</p>\n<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Personality modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p>Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in the class. The die becomes a d8 at 5th level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Jack_of_All_Trades\" class=\"mw-headline\">Jack of All Trades</span></h3>\n<p>Starting at 2nd level, you can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to any ability check you make that doesn't already include your proficiency bonus.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Song_of_Rest\" class=\"mw-headline\">Song of Rest</span></h3>\n<p>Beginning at 2nd level, you can use soothing music or oration to help revitalize your wounded allies during a short rest. If you or any friendly creatures who can hear your performance regain hit points at the end of the short rest by spending one more more Hit Dice, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points.</p>\n<p>The extra hit points increase when you reach certain levels in the class to 1d8 at 9th level, to 1d10 at 13th level, and to 1d12 at 17th level.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Bard_College\" class=\"mw-headline\">Bard College</span></h3>\n<p>At 3rd level, you delve into the advanced techniques of a bard college of your choice.

When the circle is complete, he drones a long incantation. A hole opens in space inside the circle, bringing a whiff of brimstone from the otherworldly plane beyond.</p>\n<p>Crouching on the floor in a dungeon intersection, an Argonian tosses a handful of small bones inscribed with mystic symbols, muttering a few words of power over them. Closing his eyes to see the visions more clearly, he nods slowly, then opens his eyes and points down the passage to his left.</p>\n<p><a class=\"mw-selflink selflink\">Mages</a> are supreme magic-users, defined and united as a class by the spells they cast. Drawing on the subtle weave of magic that permeates the cosmos, mages cast spells of explosive fire, arcing lightning, subtle deception, and brute-force mind control. Their magic conjures monsters from other planes of existence, glimpses the future, or knit the wounds of their allies. Their mightiest spells change one substance into another, call meteors down from the sky, or open portals to other worlds.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Scholars_of_the_Arcane\" class=\"mw-headline\">Scholars of the Arcane</span></h2>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Wild and enigmatic, varied in form and function, the power of magic draws students who seek to master its mysteries. Some aspire to become like the gods, shaping reality itself. Though the casting of a typical spell requires merely the utterance of a few strange words, fleeting gestures, and sometimes a pinch or clump of exotic materials, these surface components barely hint at the expertise attained after years of apprenticeship and countless hours of study.</p>\n<p>Mages live and die by their spells. Everything else is secondary. They learn new spells as they experiment and grow in experience. They can also learn them from other mages, from ancient tomes or inscriptions, and from ancient creatures that are steeped in magic.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"The_Lures_of_Knowledge\" class=\"mw-headline\">The Lures of Knowledge</span></h2>\n<p>Mages’ lives are seldom mundane. The closest a mage is likely to come to an ordinary life is working as a sage or lecturer in a library or university, teaching others the secrets of the Mundas. Other mages sell their services as diviners, serve in military forces, or pursue lives of crime or domination.</p>\n<p>But the lure of knowledge and power calls even the most unadventurous mages out of the safety of their libraries and laboratories and into crumbling ruins and lost cities. Most mages believe that their counterparts in ancient civilizations knew secrets of magic that have been lost to the ages, and discovering those secrets could unlock the path to a power greater than any magic available in the present age.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Creating_a_Mage\" class=\"mw-headline\">Creating a Mage</span></h2>\n<p>Creating a mage character demands a backstory dominated by at least one extraordinary event. How did your character first come into contact with magic? How did you discover you had an aptitude for it? Do you have a natural talent, or did you simply study hard and practice incessantly? Did you encounter a magical creature or an ancient tome that taught you the basics of magic?</p>\n<p>What drew you forth from your life of study? Did your first taste of magical knowledge leave you hungry for more? Have you received word of a secret repository of knowledge not yet plundered by any other mage? Perhaps you’re simply eager to put your new-found magical skills to the test in the face of danger.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Mage_Class_Table\" class=\"mw-headline\">Mage Class Table</span></h3>\n<table class=\"uestrpgtable\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Level</th>\n<th>Proficiency Bonus</th>\n<th>Features</th>\n<th>Focus Points</th>\n<th>Cantrips Known</th>\n<th>Magicka</th>\n<th>Spell Level</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Mage#Spellcasting\">Spellcasting</a>, <a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Mage#Magical_Focus\">Magical Focus</a></td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>1st</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Mage#Arcane_Tradition\">Arcane Tradition</a></td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>1st</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Mage#Metamagic\">Metamagic</a></td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>2nd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Mage#Attribute_Score_Improvement\">Attribute Score Improvement </a></td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>2nd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>27</td>\n<td>3rd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Mage#Arcane_Tradition\">Arcane Tradition Feature</a></td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>32</td>\n<td>3rd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>38</td>\n<td>4th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Mage#Attribute_Score_Improvement\">Attribute Score Improvement </a></td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>44</td>\n<td>4th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>57</td>\n<td>5th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Mage#Arcane_Tradition\">Arcane Tradition Feature</a></td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>64</td>\n<td>5th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>73</td>\n<td>6th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Mage#Attribute_Score_Improvement\">Attribute Score Improvement </a></td>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>73</td>\n<td>6th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>83</td>\n<td>7th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Mage#Arcane_Tradition\">Arcane Tradition Feature</a></td>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>83</td>\n<td>7th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>94</td>\n<td>8th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Mage#Attribute_Score_Improvement\">Attribute Score Improvement </a></td>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>94</td>\n<td>8th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>+6</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>107</td>\n<td>9th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>+6</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Mage#Spell_Mastery\">Spell Mastery</a></td>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>114</td>\n<td>9th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>+6</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Mage#Attribute_Score_Improvement\">Attribute Score Improvement </a></td>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>123</td>\n<td>9th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>+6</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Mage#Signature_Spells\">Signature Spells</a></td>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>133</td>\n<td>9th</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3><span id=\"Quick_Build\" class=\"mw-headline\">Quick Build</span></h3>\n<p>You can make a mage quickly by following these suggestions.

Your spellbook is the repository of the mage spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.</p>\n<h4><span id=\"Preparing_and_Casting_Spells\" class=\"mw-headline\">Preparing and Casting Spells</span></h4>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Mage#Mage_Class_Table\">Mage table</a> shows how much magicka you have to cast your mage spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend magicka, as noted in the spell's description and the Magicka Cost table found in chapter 10 of the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Basic Rules\" href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/Basic_Rules\"><em>Basic Rules</em></a>. You regain all expended magicka when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p>You prepare the list of mage spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of mage spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your mage level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you can cast.</p>\n<p>For example, if you're a 3rd-level mage, you can cast a prepared spell at either 1st or 2nd level. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <a class=\"extiw\" title=\"dndbeyond:spells/magic-missile\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/magic-missile\"><em>magic missile</em></a>, you can cast it at either 1st or 2nd level. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\n<p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of mage spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\n<div class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">See also: <a class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Spellcasting\" href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/Spellcasting\">Spellcasting</a></div>\n<h4><span id=\"Spellcasting_Attribute\" class=\"mw-headline\">Spellcasting Attribute</span></h4>\n<p>Intelligence is your spellcasting attribute for your mage spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting attribute. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a mage spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>\n<dl>\n<dd><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dd>\n<dl>\n<dd><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n<h4><span id=\"Ritual_Casting\" class=\"mw-headline\">Ritual Casting</span></h4>\n<p>You can cast a mage spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook.

This wellspring is represented by Focus Points, which allow you to create a variety of magical effects.</p>\n<h4><span id=\"Focus_Points\" class=\"mw-headline\">Focus Points</span></h4>\n<p>You have 2 focus points, and you gain more as you reach higher levels, as shown in the Focus Points column of the <a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Mage#Mage_Class_Table\">Mage table</a>. You can never have more focus points than shown on the table for your level. You regain all spent focus points when finish a long rest.</p>\n<h4><span id=\"Flexible_Casting\" class=\"mw-headline\">Flexible Casting</span></h4>\n<p>You can use your focus points to gain additional magicka, or sacrifice magicka to gain additional focus points. You learn other ways to use your focus points as you reach higher levels.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Creating Magicka.</strong></em> You can transform unexpended focus points into an equal number of magicka points as a bonus action on you turn (one-to-one conversion). You can create magicka, up to a maximum of 7 points in this manner.</p>\n<p>Any magicka you create with this feature vanishes when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Converting Magicka to Focus Points.</strong></em> As a bonus action on your turn, you can expend a number of magicka to gain an equal number of focus points.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Arcane_Tradition\" class=\"mw-headline\">Arcane Tradition</span></h3>\n<p>When you reach 2nd level, you choose a school of magic that you have an innate mastery over.

A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw.</p>\n<h4><span id=\"Distant_Spell\" class=\"mw-headline\">Distant Spell</span></h4>\n<p>When you cast a spell that has a range of 5 feet or greater, you can spend 1 focus point to double the range of the spell.</p>\n<p>When you cast a spell that has a range of touch, you can spend 1 focus point to make the range of the spell 30 feet.</p>\n<h4><span id=\"Empowered_Spell\" class=\"mw-headline\">Empowered Spell</span></h4>\n<p>When you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 1 focus point to reroll a number of the damage dice up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one). You must use the new rolls.</p>\n<p>You can use the Empowered Spell even if you have already used a different metamagic option during the casting of the spell.</p>\n<h4><span id=\"Expanded_Spell\" class=\"mw-headline\">Expanded Spell</span></h4>\n<p>When you cast a spell with an area of effect, you can spend 3 focus points to increase the spell's area of effect by 5 feet for a radius, cube, or cone, or extend the length of a ling by 15 feet.</p>\n<p>For each additional 3 focus points spent, you can increase the spell's area of effect further by its listed increment.</p>\n<h4><span id=\"Extended_Spell\" class=\"mw-headline\">Extended Spell</span></h4>\n<p>When you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can spend 1 focus point to double its duration, to a maximum duration of 24 hours.</p>\n<h4><span id=\"Heightened_Spell\" class=\"mw-headline\">Heightened Spell</span></h4>\n<p>When you cast a spell that forces a creature to make a saving throw to resist its effects, you can spend 3 focus points to give one target of the spell disadvantage on its first saving throw made against the spell.</p>\n<h4><span id=\"Quickened_Spell\" class=\"mw-headline\">Quickened Spell</span></h4>\n<p>When you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can spend 2 focus points to change the casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting.</p>\n<h4><span id=\"Subtle_Spell\" class=\"mw-headline\">Subtle Spell</span></h4>\n<p>When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 focus point to cast it without any somatic or verbal components.</p>\n<h4><span id=\"Twinned_Spell\" class=\"mw-headline\">Twinned Spell</span></h4>\n<p>When you cast a spell that targets only one creature and doesn't have a range of self, you can spend a number of focus points equal to the spell's level to target a second creature in range with the same spell (1 focus point if the spell is a cantrip).</p>\n<p>To be eligible, a spell must be incapable of targeting more than one creature at the spell's current level.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Attribute_Score_Improvement\" class=\"mw-headline\">Attribute Score Improvement</span></h3>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one attribute score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two attribute scores of your choice by 1.

Choose a 1st level mage spell and a 2nd level mage spell that you know. You can cast those two spells at their lowest level without expending magicka. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend magicka as normal.</p>\n<p>By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the spells you chose for a different spell of the same level.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Signature_Spells\" class=\"mw-headline\">Signature Spells</span></h3>\n<p>When you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful spells and can cast them with little effort.

Mastering alteration magicks requires an understanding of the fundamentals of nature, as the spells within are bound by nature's rules.\n<p>Casting alteration spells is akin to convincing a greater power that it is easier to change reality than it is to leave it alone.

It is a tenuous link, meant to lure, hold, and dismiss, but in the hand of a master, it becomes much stronger.</p>\n<p>Detractors of conjuration believe that the pursuit of summoning and control is desperate and dangerous, however, conjurers understand the risks of their power. As a mage of the School of Conjuration, you have learned how to summon powerful elemental daedra to serve as guardians and protectors, and sometimes as servants and familiars.

A priest might learn formulaic prayers, ancient rites, or common spells, but the ability to call on their unique potential relies on devotion and an intuitive sense of a deity’s wishes.</p>\n<p>Priests combine the helpful magic of healing and inspiring their allies with spells that harm and hinder foes. They can provoke awe and dread, lay curses of plague or poison, and even call down flames to consume their enemies. For those evildoers who will benefit most from a mace to the head, certain priests will develop their combat training to let them wade into melee with the power of the gods on their side.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Divine_Agents\" class=\"mw-headline\">Divine Agents</span></h2>\n<p>Not every acolyte or officiant at a temple or shrine is a priest. Some priests are called to a simple life of temple service, carrying out their gods’ will through prayer and sacrifice, not by magic and strength of arms. In some cities, priesthood amounts to a political office, viewed as a stepping stone to higher positions of authority and involving no communion with a god at all. True priests are rare in most hierarchies.</p>\n<p>When a priest takes up an adventuring life, it is usually because their god demands it. Pursuing the goals of the gods often involves braving dangers beyond the walls of civilization, smiting evil, or seeking holy relics in ancient tombs. Many priests are also expected to protect their deities’ worshipers, which can mean repelling a necromancer's undead army, negotiating peace between warring nations, or sealing a portal that would allow a Daedric Prince to enter the world.</p>\n<p>Most adventuring priests maintain some connection to established temples and orders of their faiths. A temple might ask for a priest’s aid, or a primate might be in a position to demand it.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Creating_a_Priest\" class=\"mw-headline\">Creating a Priest</span></h2>\n<p>As you create a priest, the most important question to consider is which deity to serve and what principles you want your character to embody.</p>\n<p>Once you’ve chosen a deity, consider your priest’s relationship to that god. Did you enter this service willingly? Or did the god choose you, impelling you into service with no regard for your wishes? How do the temple acolytes of your faith regard you: as a champion or a troublemaker? What are your ultimate goals? Does your deity have a special task in mind for you? Or are you striving to prove yourself worthy of a great quest?</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Priest_Class_Table\" class=\"mw-headline\">Priest Class Table</span></h3>\n<h3><span id=\"Priest_Class_Table\" class=\"mw-headline\"></span></h3>\n<table class=\"uestrpgtable\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Level</th>\n<th>Proficiency Bonus</th>\n<th>Features</th>\n<th>Cantrips Known</th>\n<th>Magicka</th>\n<th>Spell Level</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Priest#Spellcasting\">Spellcasting</a>, <a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Priest#Divine_Calling\">Divine Calling</a></td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>1st</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Priest#Channel_Divinity\">Channel Divinity (1/Rest)</a>, <a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Priest#Divine_Calling\">Divine Calling Feature</a></td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>1st</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>2nd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Priest#Attribute_Score_Improvement\">Attribute Score Improvement </a></td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>2nd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Priest#Destroy_Undead\">Destroy Undead (CR 1/2)</a></td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>27</td>\n<td>3rd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Priest#Channel_Divinity\">Channel Divinity (2/Rest)</a>, <a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Priest#Divine_Calling\">Divine Calling Feature</a></td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>32</td>\n<td>3rd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>38</td>\n<td>4th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Priest#Attribute_Score_Improvement\">Attribute Score Improvement </a>, <a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Priest#Destroy_Undead\">Destroy Undead (CR 1)</a>, <a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Priest#Divine_Calling\">Divine Calling Feature</a></td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>44</td>\n<td>4th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>57</td>\n<td>5th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Priest#Divine_Intervention\">Divine Intervention</a></td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>64</td>\n<td>5th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Priest#Destroy_Undead\">Destroy Undead (CR 2)</a></td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>73</td>\n<td>6th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Priest#Attribute_Score_Improvement\">Attribute Score Improvement </a></td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>73</td>\n<td>6th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>83</td>\n<td>7th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Priest#Destroy_Undead\">Destroy Undead (CR 3)</a></td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>83</td>\n<td>7th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>94</td>\n<td>8th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Priest#Attribute_Score_Improvement\">Attribute Score Improvement </a></td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>94</td>\n<td>8th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>+6</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Priest#Destroy_Undead\">Destroy Undead (CR 4)</a>, <a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Priest#Divine_Calling\">Divine Calling Feature</a></td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>107</td>\n<td>9th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>+6</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Priest#Channel_Divinity\">Channel Divinity (3/Rest)</a></td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>114</td>\n<td>9th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>+6</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Priest#Attribute_Score_Improvement\">Attribute Score Improvement </a></td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>123</td>\n<td>9th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>+6</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Priest#Divine_Intervention\">Divine Intervention Improvement</a></td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>133</td>\n<td>9th</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3><span id=\"Quick_Build\" class=\"mw-headline\">Quick Build</span></h3>\n<p>You can make a priest quickly by following these suggestions.

You regain all expended magicka points when you finish a long rest. For example, if you know the 1st-level spell <a class=\"extiw\" title=\"dndbeyond:spells/cure-wounds\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/cure-wounds\"><em>cure wounds</em></a> and have a spell level of 2nd, you can use magicka points to cast <a class=\"extiw\" title=\"dndbeyond:spells/cure-wounds\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/cure-wounds\"><em>cure wounds</em></a> at either level.</p>\n<p>You prepare the list of priest spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the <a title=\"BR:Priest Spells\" href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Priest_Spells\">priest spell list</a>.

Preparing a new list of priest spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Spellcasting_Attribute\" class=\"mw-headline\">Spellcasting Attribute</span></h3>\n<p>Willpower is your spellcasting attribute for your priest spells; your understanding of these spells comes from devoted understanding and a unique connection to your deity. You use your Willpower whenever a priest spell refers to your spellcasting attribute.

Choose a calling from: Bastion of Light, Healer, or Pilgrim. This calling shapes the priest's attitudes, dispositions, and gives direction to how they interact with the world around them. This calling also directly governs the gifts from their deity. While in a pantheon, every deity has influence over different aspects of mortal life and civilization, these spheres of influence touch on your purpose, but your power comes from your connection to your purpose.</p>\n<p>Your calling might correspond to a particular sect dedicated to your deity. Arkay, for example, could be worshiped in one region as Ark'ay, emphasizing his influence over the birth, life, and consecration of the dead, and in a different place as Orkey, emphasizing his association with death and burial ceremonies. Alternatively, your choice of calling could simply be a matter of personal preference, the aspect of the deity that appeals to you most.</p>\n<p>Your choice grants you calling spells and other features when you choose it at 1st level.

You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.</p>\n<p>Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your priest spell save DC.</p>\n<p>Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Channel_Divinity:_Turn_Undead\" class=\"mw-headline\">Channel Divinity: Turn Undead</span></h3>\n<p>As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the unholy undead.

If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.</p>\n<p>A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving.

In each pantheon, every deity has influence over different aspects of Mundas, typically known as their sphere or domain. For example, the influence of the Divine goddess Mara includes the domain of Life, Love, and Compassion. As a priest, you choose an aspect of your deity’s influence to emphasize, and you are granted powers related to that calling.</p>\n<p>Your choice might correspond to a particular sect dedicated to your deity. Akatosh, for example, could be worshiped in one region as Auri-El, emphasizing his influence over the sphere of Light, and in a different place as Alkosh, emphasizing his association with the Life ordinance. Alternatively, your choice of ordinance could simply be a matter of personal preference, the aspect of the deity that appeals to you most.</p>\n<p>Each calling’s description gives examples of deities who have influence over that calling.
