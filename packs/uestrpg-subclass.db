Others, such as the Akaviri have come to master the celestial powers of the twilight, allowing them to infuse such energy into their weapons.

By switching your stance, you call on the powers of the dawn and of the dusk. <br /><br />Once on each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to enter into a stance or switch from one stance to the other. Each stance has benefits that you gain while you are using that stance, and you retain these benefits until you change your stance or use a bonus action to end it. <br /><br /><em><strong>Dawn Stance.</strong></em> When you enter this stance, your weapon becomes enchanted with the Light arcane imbuement. While in this stance, you gain the ability to call forth the radiant dawn. As a bonus action on subsequent turns, you suffuse your imbued weapon with light as if it were targeted by the light cantrip. Invisible creatures within this light appear with a glowing silhouette that is only visible to you. Once on each of your turns, when you hit a creature with this weapon, the creature also illuminates as if it were targeted by the light cantrip until the start of your next turn. <br /><br /><em><strong>Dusk Stance.</strong></em> When you enter this stance, your weapon becomes enchanted with the Decay arcane imbuement. While in this stance, your steps are shrouded as the dark of night. When you are in dim light or darkness, you make any Agility (Stealth) checks with advantage, and you can take the Hide action as a bonus action on each of your turns.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Gloom_and_Radiance\" class=\"mw-headline\">Gloom and Radiance</span></h2>\n<p><em>6th-level Twilight Dualist feature</em><br />When you are hit by an attack, you can use your reaction to become protected in an aura of gloom or radiance.

When a creature you can see moves into a space within 10 feet of you or starts its turn there, you can use your reaction to spread a disease that you know, forcing the creature to make an Endurance saving throw. The DC for the saving throw is equal to your spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature suffers the effects of the chosen disease for the next 10 minutes. If more than one creature starts its turn within 10 feet of you, you can choose which creature to spread the disease to.

The corpse or creature explodes in a burst of disease, forcing each creature within 10 feet of it to make an Endurance saving throw. On a failed save, each creature takes 2d8 necrotic damage for each Soul Point expended and they are infected with the same disease the creature was infected with.

This mark lasts for one week, until the creature dies, or until you mark another creature in the same manner.</p>\n<p>A creature marked in this manner takes extra necrotic damage whenever it takes bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage.

While empowered this way, the first time you hit a target with an attack, you deal an extra 1d8 necrotic damage to that attack.

The creature must succeed on a Personality saving throw against your spell save DC or use its reaction to move up to 30 feet in a direction of your choice.

Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a spell you’ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can’t use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the GM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.</li>\n</ul>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Basic Rules v1.4 pg 82","levels":3,"subclass":"Hunter","hitDice":"d10","hitDiceUsed":0,"saves":["dex","con"],"skills":{"number":3,"choices":["ani","ath","ins","inv","nat","prc","ste","sur"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"none","ability":"wis"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"7p78eooyEyF8LXNq":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.0y3z0nNQqgFsjEgx"},"cf":{"id":"temp_okmopmjbsu9","path":"Classes#/CF_SEP/Subclasses#/CF_SEP/Ranger","color":"#000000"}}}

Being immersed in new cultures and always surrounding themselves with new ideas keeps their minds and hearts open.</p>\n<p>They are well-versed in tomes of old, and get through life by bartering in the market or persuading the weak-minded. Pilgrims are naturally charismatic and their travels bring fascinating stories to tell. Their journeys can also bring out a nefarious side. The inability to lay down roots and build long lasting relationships can cause a person to grow cold and self-indulgent. Some pilgrims find themselves akin to snake-oil salesmen, profiting off of scams or deceit before moving on to the next mark.</p>\n<p>A priest with this calling might follow Baan Dar, Clavicus Vile, Dibella, Sanguine, Sheogorath, St. Veloth, Vivec, Zenithar.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Pilgrim Features</strong></p>\n<table class=\"uestrpgtable\"><caption> </caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Level</th>\n<th>Feature</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1st</td>\n<td>Calling Spells, Bonus Proficiencies, Eye for Danger</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2nd</td>\n<td>Channel Divinity: Gathered Secrets</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6th</td>\n<td>Deceit and Influence, Wayfarer’s Path</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8th</td>\n<td>Divine Strike</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17th</td>\n<td>Eye for Weak Points</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2><span id=\"Calling_Spells\" class=\"mw-headline\">Calling Spells</span></h2>\n<p><em>1st-level Pilgrim Calling feature</em></p>\n<p>You gain calling spells at the priest levels listed in the Pilgrim Calling Spells table.

Additionally, you gain resistance to your elemental attunement damage type. <br /><br /><em><strong>Earth.</strong></em> The damage type is bludgeoning. <br /><br /><em><strong>Flame.</strong></em> The damage type is fire. <br /><br /><em><strong>Storm.</strong></em> The damage type is lighting. <br /><br /><em><strong>Water.</strong></em> The damage type is cold.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Elemental_Form\" class=\"mw-headline\">Elemental Form</span></h2>\n<p>When you reach 14th level, your form becomes that of your chosen elemental attunement. As an action, you magically transform into an atronach that is associated with your element. This magical transformation lasts for 1 hour, and can be ended early as a bonus action. While in this new form, you assume the stats of the atronach of your elemental attunement. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest. (Refer to the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Basic Rules\" href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/Basic_Rules\"><em>Basic Rules</em></a> appendix A and the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Enemies of Elsweyr\" href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/Enemies_of_Elsweyr\"><em>Enemies of Elsweyr</em></a> chapter 3 for atronach stats.) <br /><br />While you are transformed, the following rules apply:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The new form can be any atronach whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the challenge rating listed in your elemental attunement below. Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the atronach, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Willpower, and Personality scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can't use them.</li>\n<li>When you transform, you assume the atronach's hit points and hit dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in your atronach form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren't knocked unconscious.</li>\n<li>You can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your atronach form. Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as call lightning, that you've already cast.</li>\n<li>You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can't use any of your special senses, such as Darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.</li>\n<li>You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br /><em><strong>Earth.</strong></em> You transform into either an iron, earth, or stone atronach with a CR of 5 or lower. At 18th level, you can transform into either an iron, earth, or stone atronach with a CR of 7 or lower. <br /><br /><em><strong>Flame.</strong></em> You transform into either a cold-flame or flame atronach with a CR of 5 or lower.

A shout requires you to spend shout points each time you use one.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Shouts.</strong></em> You know the <em>Unrelenting Force</em> shout and two other shouts of your choice, which are detailed in the <strong>“Dragon Shouts”</strong> section at the end of the subclass description. You learn two additional shouts of your choice at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</p>\n<p>Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the dragon shouts you know and replace it with another dragon shout that you could learn at that level.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Shout Points.</strong></em> You have 2 shout points and you regain any expended shout points when you finish a short or long rest.

While the effects of a dragon shout are considered spells, they break some of the rules of spellcasting:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can use shouts even while raging.</li>\n<li>You require the ability to speak to be able to use a dragon shout.</li>\n<li>You do not require to use somatic or material components to cast spells as a dragon shout.</li>\n<li>Dragon shouts that create spells or effects that have a duration longer than instantaneous do not require concentration to maintain. You can only have one effect active at a time and any effects immediately end if you are incapacitated or cast another shout with a duration longer than instantaneous.</li>\n<li>You can only use one shout on each turn.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some dragon shouts require the target to make a saving throw to resist its effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>\n<p><strong>Dragon Shout save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Endurance modifier</p>\n<p>Once you reach 6th level in this class, you can spend additional shout points to increase the power of a shout that you cast, provided that it has an enhanced effect, as Unrelenting Force does.</p>\n<p>The maximum number of shout points you can spend to cast a shout in this way (including its base shout point cost and any additional shout points you spend to increase its effect) is determined by your barbarian level, as shown in the Maximum Shout Points table below.</p>\n<p><strong>Maximum Shout Points</strong></p>\n<table class=\"uestrpgtable\"><caption> </caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Barbarian Level</th>\n<th>Max.

See the Chapter 10 of the Basic Rules for the general rules of spellcasting and Chapter 11 for the warden spell list. <br /><br /><em><strong>Cantrips.</strong></em> You learn two cantrips of your choice from the warden spell list. You learn an additional cantrip of your choice at 10th level. <br /><br /><em><strong>Magicka.</strong></em> The Green Pact Spellcasting table shows how much magicka you have to cast your warden spells of 1st level and higher. The table also shows what the level spells you can cast. To cast one of your warden spells of 1st level or higher, must expend magicka, as noted in the spell's description and the Magicka Cost table found in chapter 10 of the Basic Rules. You regain all expended magicka when you finish a long rest. <br /><br />For example, if you know the 1st-level spell hail of thorns and have a Spell Level of 2nd, you can cast hail of thorns using magicka to cast it at either level. <br /><br /><em><strong>Spells known of 1st level and higher.</strong></em> You know three 1st-level warden spells of your choice from the warden spell list. <br /><br />The Spells Known column of the Green Pact Spellcasting table shows when you learn more warden spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you can cast, as shown on the table's Spell Level column for your level. When you reach 7th level, for example, you learn a new warden spell, which can be 1st or 2nd level.</p>\n<table class=\"uestrpgtable\"><caption>Green Pact Keeper Spellcasting</caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Ranger Level</th>\n<th>Cantrips Known</th>\n<th>Spells Known</th>\n<th>Magicka Points</th>\n<th>Spell Level</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3rd</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>1st</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4th</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>1st</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5th</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>1st</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6th</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>1st</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7th</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>2nd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8th</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>2nd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9th</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>2nd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10th</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>2nd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11th</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>2nd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12th</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>2nd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13th</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>27</td>\n<td>3rd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14th</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>27</td>\n<td>3rd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15th</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>27</td>\n<td>3rd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16th</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>32</td>\n<td>3rd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17th</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>32</td>\n<td>3rd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18th</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>32</td>\n<td>3rd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19th</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>38</td>\n<td>4th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20th</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>38</td>\n<td>4th</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><br /><br />Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the warden spells you know and replace it with another spell from the warden spell list, which also must be of a level for which you can cast. <br /><br /><em><strong>Spellcasting Attribute.</strong></em> Willpower is your spellcasting attribute for your warden spells, so you use your Willpower whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting attribute.

Many tactics enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one tactic per attack. <br /><br />You learn two additional tactics of your choice at 7th, 10th, and 15th level. Each time you learn new tactics, you can also replace one tactic you know with a different one. <br /><br /><em><strong>Tactical Dice.</strong></em> You have four tactical dice, which are d8s. A tactical die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended tactical dice when you finish a short or long rest. <br /><br />You gain another tactical die at 7th level and one more at 15th level. <br /><br /><em><strong>Saving Throws.</strong></em> Some of your tactics require your target to make a saving throw to resist the tactic’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows: <br /><br /><em><strong>Tactic save DC</strong></em> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Agility modifier (your choice)</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Hardy\" class=\"mw-headline\">Hardy</span></h2>\n<p><em>7th-level Mercenary feature</em><br /><br />You have learned to roll with both the punches and the fireballs.

When you do so, choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you and expend one tactical die. That creature can immediately use its reaction to make one weapon attack, adding a tactical die to the attack's damage roll. <br /><br /><em><strong>Disarming Attack.</strong></em> When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one tactical die to attempt to disarm the target, forcing it to drop one item of your choice that it's holding. You add the tactical die to the attack's damage roll, and the target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it drops the object you choose. The object lands at its feet. <br /><br /><em><strong>Feinting Attack.</strong></em> You can expend one tactical die and use a bonus action on your turn to feint, choosing one creature within 5 feet of you as your target. You have advantage on your next attack roll against that creature this turn. If that attack hits, add the tactical die to the attack's damage roll. <br /><br /><em><strong>Goading Attack.</strong></em> When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one tactical die to attempt to goad the target into attacking you. You add the tactical die to the attack's damage roll, and the target must make a Willpower saving throw. On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on all attack rolls against targets other than you until the end of your next turn. <br /><br /><em><strong>Menacing Attack.</strong></em> When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one tactical die to attempt to frighten the target. You add your tactical die to the attacks damage roll, and the target must make a Personality saving throw. On a failed save, it is frightened until it's next turn. <br /><br /><em><strong>Rally.</strong></em> On your turn, you can use a bonus action and expend one tactical die to bolster the resolve of one of your companions. When you do so, choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you. That creature gains temporary hit points equal to the tactical die roll + your Personality modifier. <br /><br /><em><strong>Sweeping Attack.</strong></em> When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one tactical die to attempt to damage another creature with the same attack. Choose another creature within 5 feet of the original target and within your reach. If the original attack roll would hit the second creature, it takes damage equal to the number you roll on your tactical die. The damage is of the same type dealt by the original attack. <br /><br /><em><strong>Trip Attack.</strong></em> When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one tactical die to attempt to knock the target down. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and if the target is Large or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you knock the target prone.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"LGtC pg 66","levels":3,"subclass":"Mercenary","hitDice":"d10","hitDiceUsed":0,"saves":["str","con"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["acr","ani","ath","his","ins","itm","prc","sur"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"none","ability":"con"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"7p78eooyEyF8LXNq":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.ekJi5CDHX59W1IpP"},"cf":{"id":"temp_z83xht9qagj","path":"Classes#/CF_SEP/Subclasses#/CF_SEP/Warrior","color":"#000000"}}}

If you succeed, when you use Precision Dice to attack a creature, you roll twice the normal amount of Precision Dice, taking the highest rolls, as though you had advantage.

With 8 hours of work and the expenditure of 200 septims worth of rare herbs and fine food, you call forth an animal from the wilderness to serve as your faithful companion from any beast with a CR of ½ or lower, such as an ape, a black bear, a boar, a giant badger, a giant weasel, a mule, a panther, or a wolf. However, your DM might pick one of these animals for you, based on the surrounding terrain and on what types of creatures would be logically present in the area. <br /><br />At the end of 8 hours, your animal companion appears and gains all the benefits of your Companion's Bond ability. You can have only one animal companion at a time. <br /><br />If your animal companion is ever slain, the magical bond you share allows you to return it to life. With 8 hours of work and the expenditure of 100 septims worth of rare herbs and fine food you call forth your companion's spirit and use your magic to create a new body for it. You can return an animal companion to life in this manner even if you do not possess any part of its body. <br /><br />If you use this ability to return a former animal companion to life while you have a current animal companion, your current companion leaves you and is replaced by the restored companion. <br /><br />If you gain a new animal companion at higher levels, you can choose from any beast with a CR as shown on the Beast Companions At Higher Levels table.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Companion's_Bond\"></span><span id=\"Companion.27s_Bond\" class=\"mw-headline\">Companion's Bond</span></h3>\n<p>Your animal companion gains a variety of benefits while it is linked to you. <br /><br />The animal companion loses it's Multiattack action, if it has one. <br /><br />The companion obeys your commands as best it can.

Your companion uses your proficiency bonus rather than its own. In addition to areas where it normally uses its proficiency bonus to its AC and to its damage rolls. <br /><br />Your animal companions gain proficiency in two skills of your choice. It also becomes proficient with all saving throws. <br /><br />For each level you gain after 2nd, your animal companion gains an additional hit die and increases its hit points accordingly. <br /><br />Whenever you gain the Attribute Score Improvement class feature, your companion's attributes also improve. Your companion can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or it can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, your companion can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature unless its description specifies otherwise. <br /><br />Your companion shares your alignment, and has a personality trait and a flaw that you can roll for or select from the tables below.

It counts as neither a creature or a an object, though it has the spectral appearance of a creature it represents. <br /><br />Your spirit companion acts independently of you, but it always obeys your commands. In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. A spirit companion can't attack, but it can take other actions as normal. <br /><br />While the spirit is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. Additionally, as an action, you can see through the spirit's eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses that the spirit has. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses. <br /><br />The spirit persists for 1 minute or until you're incapacitated.

While you are within 30 feet of the spirit, you and your beast companion ignore difficult terrain, and when you or your beast companion make a running long jump, the distance you can cover increases by a number of feet equal to your Willpower modifier. <br /><br /><em><strong>Mouse.</strong></em> You summon the spirit of a mouse.

If you are already proficient in one of these tools, you gain proficiency with another type of artisan’s tools of your choice. You can use these tools as an arcane focus for casting your spells. <br /><br />Additionally, the amount of septims and time you must spend to craft acid, alchemist’s fire, antitoxin, oil, perfume, potions, soap, or other concoctions is halved when using alchemist supplies or an herbalism kit. <br /><br />When making an attack with a vial or flask, you are considered proficient in the attack and you can use your Agility or Intelligence modifier for the attack roll.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Alchemical_Experiments\" class=\"mw-headline\">Alchemical Experiments</span></h2>\n<p><em>2nd-level Alchemist feature</em><br /><br />Whenever you finish a long rest, you can magically produce an alchemical experiment in an empty flask you touch, choosing from the list below. As an action, a creature can drink the alchemical experiment, administer it to an incapacitated creature, or throw the flask at a creature within range. <br /><br />Creating an alchemical experiment requires you to have alchemist's supplies on your person, and any experiment you create with this feature lasts until it is used or until the end of your next long rest. When you reach certain levels in this class, you can make more experiments at the end of a long rest: two at 6th level and three at 15th level. Each experiment requires its own flask. <br /><br /><em><strong>Alchemical Acid.</strong></em> This vial of caustic liquid can be splashed on a creature within 5 feet of you, or be thrown with a range of 20/60, shattering on impact. On a hit, the creature takes 3d6 acid damage. An object automatically takes that damage, and the damage is maximized. This experiment's damage increases by 3d6 when you reach certain levels: 5th level (6d6), 11th level (9d6), and 17th level (12d6). <br /><br /><em><strong>Alchemical Fire.</strong></em> This vial of volatile liquid can be hurled at a creature, object, or surface within 30 feet of you. On impact, the vial detonates in a 5-foot-radius sphere. Any creature in that area must succeed on an Agility saving throw against your spell save DC or take 2d6 fire damage. This experiment's damage increases by 2d6 when you reach certain levels: 5th level (4d6), 11th level (6d6), and 17th level (8d6). <br /><br /><em><strong>Elixir of Alacrity.</strong></em> A creature that drinks this swirling yellow liquid has their speed increased by 10 feet for 1 hour. <br /><br /><em><strong>Healing Draught.</strong></em> A creature that drinks this healing liquid regains 1d8 hit points. This experiment's healing increases by 1d8 when you reach certain levels in this class: 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Advanced_Chemistry\" class=\"mw-headline\">Advanced Chemistry</span></h2>\n<p><em>6th-level Alchemist feature</em><br /><br />The creations you make using your alchemist’s supplies or herbalism kit, or from your Alchemical Experiments or Spell Infused Potions features become more potent. Whenever an item you’ve created from these tools or features restores hit points or deals damage, you can add your Intelligence modifier to the total rolled. <br /><br />Additionally, you have learned how to quickly analyze potions you find. If you spend 1 minute studying a potion, you can expend 1 focus point to learn its properties as though you had cast the identify spell.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Spell_Infused_Potions\" class=\"mw-headline\">Spell Infused Potions</span></h2>\n<p><em>6th-level Alchemist feature</em><br /><br />Whenever you finish a long rest, you can magically produce a spell infused potion in an empty flask you touch. You create a potion that is infused with a spell that is in your spellbook, has a casting time of 1 action, a duration of instantaneous, and that is of a level that you can cast to a maximum of 3rd level, without expending magicka points, without preparing the spell, and without material components. <br /><br />As a bonus action, a creature can drink the potion and then use their action on the same turn to cast the spell that has been infused in the potion, using your spell save DC and spell attack bonus. <br /><br />Creating a spell infused potion requires you to have alchemist's supplies on your person, and any potion you create with this feature lasts until it is drunk or until the end of your next long rest. <br /><br />You can create additional spell infused potions by expending magicka points as though you cast the spell and a number of focus points equal to the spell’s level for each one. When you do so, you use your action to create the potion in an empty flask you touch. To create a potion in this way, you must have the spell prepared and provide the material components required by the spell.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Adroit_Alchemy\" class=\"mw-headline\">Adroit Alchemy</span></h2>\n<p><em>10th-level Alchemist feature</em><br /><br />Once on each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to drink a potion or administer one to an incapacitated creature. A creature that drinks a potion this way can’t use their action to drink a second potion. <br /><br />Additionally, the distance you can throw a vial or flask as part of an attack is doubled.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Alkahest_Mastery\" class=\"mw-headline\">Alkahest Mastery</span></h2>\n<p><em>14th-level Alchemist feature</em><br /><br />You have mastered your alchemical formulas and can manipulate their very essence. When you create an alchemical experiment or spell infused potion, you can expend focus points to alter their effects. <br /><br />◈ When you create an alchemical experiment or spell infused potion that deals acid, fire, or poison damage, you can expend 1 focus point to change the damage type to your choice of acid, fire, or poison. <br /><br />◈ When you create an alchemical experiment or spell infused potion, you can expend 2 focus points to also infuse it with the greater restoration spell without material components. Once you infuse a creation in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"LGtC pg 22","levels":2,"subclass":"School of Alchemy","hitDice":"d6","hitDiceUsed":0,"saves":["int","wis"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","his","ins","inv","med","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"int"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"7p78eooyEyF8LXNq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_tsc3gw5oe4","path":"Classes#/CF_SEP/Subclasses#/CF_SEP/Mage","color":"#000000"}}}

You are immune to being charmed, and when another creature attempts to charm you, you can use your reaction to attempt to turn the charm back on that creature.

When you cast a spell or use an ability to charm one or more creatures, you can alter one creature's understanding so that it remains unaware that it is being charmed.</p>\n<p>Additionally, once before the spell or effect expires, you can use your action to try to modify the chosen creature's memory of some of the time it spent while charmed. The creature must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw against your nightblade spell save DC. On a failed save, you can modify a number of hours of its memories equal to 1 + your Personality modifier (minimum 1). You can choose to modify less time if desired, and the amount of time can't exceed the duration of your illusion spell.</p>\n<p>A modified memory doesn’t necessarily affect how a creature behaves, particularly if the memory contradicts the creature’s natural inclinations, alignment, or beliefs. An illogical modified memory, such as implanting a memory of how much the creature enjoyed dousing itself in acid, is dismissed, perhaps as a bad dream. The DM might deem a modified memory too nonsensical to affect a creature in a significant manner.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Basic Rules v1.4 pg 73","levels":1,"subclass":"Trickster","hitDice":"d8","hitDiceUsed":0,"saves":["dex","int"],"skills":{"number":3,"choices":["acr","arc","ath","dec","his","ins","inv","prc","slt","ste"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"pact","ability":"cha"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"7p78eooyEyF8LXNq":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.iMO7NRNcLzk3RjEi"},"cf":{"id":"temp_n54m2trf2bi","path":"Classes#/CF_SEP/Subclasses#/CF_SEP/Nightblade","color":"#000000"}}}

A shout requires you to spend stamina points each time you use one. When you use a shout that requires you to expend 2 stamina points or less, you can choose not to expend any stamina points a number of times equal to half your proficiency bonus (rounded up). Once you use a shout in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Shouts.</strong></em> You know the <em>Unrelenting Force</em> shout and two other shouts of your choice, which are detailed in the <strong>“Dragon Shouts”</strong> section at the end of the subclass description. You learn two additional shouts of your choice at 6th, 11th, and 17th level. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the dragon shouts you know and replace it with another dragon shout that you could learn at that level.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Using Words of Power.</strong></em> The Thu'um is a form of magic which uses words from the <a class=\"extiw\" title=\"uesp:Lore:Dragon Language\" href=\"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Dragon_Language\">draconic</a> language to form powerful shouts. While the effects of a dragon shout are considered spells, they break some of the rules of spellcasting:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You require the ability to speak to be able to use a dragon shout.</li>\n<li>You do not require to use somatic or material components to cast spells as a dragon shout.</li>\n<li>Dragon shouts that create spells or effects that have a duration longer than instantaneous do not require concentration to maintain. You can only have one effect active at a time and any effects immediately end if you are incapacitated or cast another shout with a duration longer than instantaneous.</li>\n<li>You can only use one shout on each turn.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You use your Stamina save DC for any shouts or spells that require a saving throw to resist its effects. Once you reach 5th level in this class, you can spend additional stamina points to increase the power of a shout that you cast, provided that it has an enhanced effect, as Unrelenting Force does. The maximum number of stamina points you can spend to cast a shout in this way (including its base stamina point cost and any additional stamina points you spend to increase its effect) is determined by your monk level, as shown in the Maximum Shout Points table below.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Maximum Shout Points</p>\n<p> </p>\n<table class=\"uestrpgtable\"><caption> </caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Monk Level</th>\n<th>Max.

You gain a new attack option that you can use with the Attack action. This special attack is a ranged spell attack with a range of 30 feet. You are proficient with it, and you add your Willpower modifier to its attack and damage rolls. Its damage is force, and its damage die is a d4. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table. This special attack is considered a monk weapon for you. When you gain the Extra Attack feature, this special attack can be used for any of the attacks you make as part of the Attack action.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Passage_of_Knowledge\" class=\"mw-headline\">Passage of Knowledge</span></h2>\n<p><em>6th-level Way of the Voice feature</em><br />Your understanding of the voice allows you to temporarily teach it to others. As an action, you whisper one of the dragon shouts you know to a creature within 5 feet of you that can speak and knows at least one language, filling its mind with the words of power. That creature can use this shout using your Stamina save DC once before it finishes a long rest. You expend stamina points for the shout as normal. You cannot spend more than 3 stamina points to use this feature. Once the shout is used, the knowledge of it vanishes from the creature’s mind. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Speed_of_the_7,000_Steps\"></span><span id=\"Speed_of_the_7.2C000_Steps\" class=\"mw-headline\">Speed of the 7,000 Steps</span></h2>\n<p><em>11th-level Way of the Voice feature</em><br />Your understanding of the Thu’um allows you to combine it with your martial arts.

See the Chapter 10 of the Basic Rules for the general rules of spellcasting and Chapter 11 for the nightblade spell list. <br /><br /><em><strong>Cantrips.</strong></em> You learn two cantrips of your choice from the nightblade spell list. You learn an additional cantrip of your choice at 10th level. <br /><br /><em><strong>Magicka.</strong></em> The Twilight Shroud Spellcasting table shows how much magicka you have to cast your nightblade spells of 1st level and higher. The table also shows what the level spells you can cast. To cast one of your nightblade spells of 1st level or higher, must expend magicka, as noted in the spell's description and the Magicka Cost table found in chapter 10 of the Basic Rules. You regain all expended magicka when you finish a long rest. <br /><br />For example, if you know the 1st-level spell invisibility and have a Spell Level of 2nd, you can cast invisibility using magicka to cast it at either level. <br /><br /><em><strong>Spells Known of 1st level and Higher.</strong></em> You know three 1st-level nightblade spells of your choice from the nightblade spell list. <br /><br />The Spells Known column of the Twilight Shroud Spellcasting table shows when you learn more nightblade spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you can cast, as shown on the table's Spell Level column for your level. When you reach 7th level, for example, you learn a new nightblade spell, which can be 1st or 2nd level. <br /><br />Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the nightblade spells you know and replace it with another spell from the nightblade spell list, which also must be of a level for which you can cast. <br /><br /><em><strong>Spellcasting Attribute.</strong></em> Personality is your spellcasting attribute for your nightblade spells, so you use your Personality whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting attribute. In addition, you use your Personality modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a nightblade spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. <br /><br /><em><strong>Spell save DC</strong></em> = 8 + your Proficiency bonus + your Personality modifier <br /><br /></p>\n<p><em><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong></em> = your Proficiency bonus + your Personality modifier</p>\n<table class=\"uestrpgtable\"><caption>Twilight Shroud Spellcasting</caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Thief Level</th>\n<th>Cantrips Known</th>\n<th>Spells Known</th>\n<th>Magicka Points</th>\n<th>Spell Level</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3rd</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>1st</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4th</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>1st</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5th</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>1st</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6th</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>1st</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7th</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>2nd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8th</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>2nd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9th</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>2nd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10th</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>2nd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11th</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>2nd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12th</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>2nd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13th</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>27</td>\n<td>3rd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14th</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>27</td>\n<td>3rd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15th</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>27</td>\n<td>3rd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16th</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>32</td>\n<td>3rd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17th</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>32</td>\n<td>3rd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18th</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>32</td>\n<td>3rd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19th</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>38</td>\n<td>4th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20th</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>38</td>\n<td>4th</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2><span id=\"Expanded_Spell_List\" class=\"mw-headline\">Expanded Spell List</span></h2>\n<p><em>3rd-level Twilight Shroud feature</em><br /><br />As a Twilight Shroud thief, you can choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a nightblade spell.

See this creature’s game statistics in the Phantasmal Spirit stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places. The spirit takes a vaguely humanoid form, which is determined by the GM. <br /><br />In combat, it shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required). Its actions are listed on its stat block, or it can take some other action. If you don't issue any commands to the spirit, it takes the Dodge action and uses its move to avoid danger. If you are incapacitated, the spirit can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.</p>\n<div id=\"contentSub\" class=\"plainlinks nourlexpansion\" style=\"position:relative\" aria-label=\"Breadcrumb\"><span class=\"subpages\">&lt; <a title=\"Bestiary\" href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/Bestiary\">Bestiary</a></span></div>\n<table class=\"stattable\" style=\"width:42%\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th><span style=\"font-size:small\">Phantasmal Spirit </span></th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"color:#ffffff;background:#8A171A\"><em>Medium undead</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;width:33%\">\n<p><span style=\"color:#8a171a\"><strong>Armor Class</strong></span> 16 (natural armor) <br /><span style=\"color:#8a171a\"><strong>Hit Points</strong></span> 5 + five times your nightblade level <br /><span style=\"color:#8a171a\"><strong>Speed</strong></span> 40 ft.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align:center;color:#8a171a;background:#EEE7DB;border:0\">STR</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:center;color:#8a171a;background:#EEE7DB;border:0\">AGI</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:center;color:#8a171a;background:#EEE7DB;border:0\">END</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:center;color:#8a171a;background:#EEE7DB;border:0\">INT</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:center;color:#8a171a;background:#EEE7DB;border:0\">WIL</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:center;color:#8a171a;background:#EEE7DB;border:0\">PER</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;color:#000000;background:#EEE7DB;border:0\">18 (+4)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;color:#000000;background:#EEE7DB;border:0\">14 (+2)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;color:#000000;background:#EEE7DB;border:0\">16 (+3)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;color:#000000;background:#EEE7DB;border:0\">10 (+0)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;color:#000000;background:#EEE7DB;border:0\">10 (+0)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;color:#000000;background:#EEE7DB;border:0\">8 (-1)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><span style=\"color:#8a171a\"><strong>Damage Immunities</strong></span> poison<br /><span style=\"color:#8a171a\"><strong>Condition Immunities</strong></span> charmed, exhaustion, frightened, poisoned <br /><span style=\"color:#8a171a\"><strong>Senses</strong></span> darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 10<br /><span style=\"color:#8a171a\"><strong>Languages</strong></span> understands the languages you speak<br /><span style=\"color:#8a171a\"><strong>Challenge</strong></span> -        <span style=\"color:#8a171a\"><strong>Proficiency Bonus</strong></span> equals your bonus</p>\n<em><strong>Immutable Form.</strong></em> The spirit is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form. <br /><br /><span style=\"color:#8a171a;font-size:small\"><strong>Actions</strong></span><br />\n<p><em><strong>Force-empowered Slam.</strong></em> Melee Weapon Attack: your spell attack modifier to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.

If the original attack roll would hit any additional creatures, they take damage equal to the number you roll on your tactical die, divided equally between the additional creatures hit. The main target only takes the damage from your original attack.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Commander's Strike.</strong></em> When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can forgo one of your attacks and use a bonus action to direct one of your companions to strike. When you do so, choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you and expend one tactical die. That creature can immediately use its reaction to make one weapon attack, adding a tactical die to the attack's damage roll.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Feinting Attack.</strong></em> You can expend one tactical die and use a bonus action on your turn to feint, choosing one creature within 5 feet of you as your target. You have advantage on your next attack roll against that creature this turn. If that attack hits, add the tactical die to the attack's damage roll.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Lunging Attack.</strong></em> When you make a melee weapon attack on your turn, you can expend one tactical die to increase your reach for the attack by 5 feet. If you hit, you add the tactical die to the attack's damage roll.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Menacing Attack.</strong></em> When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one tactical die to attempt to frighten the target. You add your tactical die to the attacks damage roll, and the target must make a Personality saving throw. On a failed save, it is frightened of you until the end of your next turn.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Pierce Armor.</strong></em> When you hit a creature that is wearing armor with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one tactical die to weaken their armor, reducing the targets AC by 1. If you hit, you add the tactical die to the attack's damage roll. You can not weaken the same armor more than once.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Precision Attack.</strong></em> When you make a weapon attack roll against a creature, you can expend one tactical die to add a tactical die to the roll. You can use this tactic before or after making the attack roll, but before any effects of the attack are applied.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Riposte.</strong></em> When an enemy misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction and expend one tactical die to make a melee weapon attack against the same enemy. If you hit, add a tactical die to the attack's damage roll.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Sweeping Attack.</strong></em> When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one tactical die to attempt to damage another creature within 5 feet of the original target and within your reach. If the original attack roll would hit the second creature, it takes damage equal to the number you roll on your tactical die. The damage is of the same type dealt for the original attack.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Uppercut.</strong></em> When you hit a creature with weapon attack, you can expend one tactical die to attempt to slam the target with an upward blow, knocking the target down. You add the tactical die to the attack's damage roll, and if the target is Large or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it is knocked back 5 feet and falls prone.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Basic Rules v1.4 pg 117","levels":3,"subclass":"Assault","hitDice":"d10","hitDiceUsed":0,"saves":["str","con"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["acr","ani","ath","his","ins","itm","prc","sur"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"none","ability":"con"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"7p78eooyEyF8LXNq":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.ekJi5CDHX59W1IpP"},"cf":{"id":"temp_z83xht9qagj","path":"Classes#/CF_SEP/Subclasses#/CF_SEP/Warrior","color":"#000000"}}}

The illusion appears in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you. The illusion looks exactly like you; it is silent; it is your size, is insubstantial, and doesn’t occupy its space; and it is unaffected by attacks and damage.

Additionally, when both you and your illusion are within 5 feet of a creature that can see the illusion, you have advantage on attack rolls against that creature, given how uncanny the illusion is.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Poison Strike.</strong></em> You can use your Channel Divinity to make a weapon deadlier. As a bonus action, you touch one weapon or piece of ammunition and conjure a special poison on it. The poison lasts for 1 minute. The next time you hit a target with an attack using that weapon or ammunition, the target takes poison damage immediately after the attack. The poison damage equals 2d10 + your crusader level, or 20 + your crusader level if you had advantage on the attack roll.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Aura_of_Treachery\" class=\"mw-headline\">Aura of Treachery</span></h2>\n<p>Starting at 7th level, you emanate an aura of discord, which gives you the following benefits.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Cull the Herd.</strong></em> You have advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature that has one or more of its allies within 5 feet of it.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Treacherous Strike.</strong></em> If a creature within 5 feet of you misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to force the attacker to reroll that attack against a creature of your choice that is also within 5 feet of the attacker. The ability fails and is wasted if the attacker is immune to being charmed.

Immediately after you are hit by an attack, you can use your reaction to turn invisible and teleport up to 60 feet to a spot you can see. You remain invisible until the end of your next turn or until you attack, deal damage, or force a creature to make a saving throw.</p>\n<p>Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Icon_of_Deceit\" class=\"mw-headline\">Icon of Deceit</span></h2>\n<p>At 20th level, you gain the ability to emanate feelings of treachery. As an action, you can magically become an avatar of deceit, gaining the following benefits for 1 minute:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You are invisible.</li>\n<li>If a creature damages you on its turn, it must succeed on a Willpower saving throw (DC equal to your spell save DC) or you control its next action, provided that you aren’t incapacitated when it takes the action.

As a bonus action on your turn, you can use a corpse of a small or larger creature that you can see and transform it into a totem of your choice. The totem is created in a location that you can see within 30 feet of you. The corpse that is used to create the totem is destroyed and can't be used again. If a totem requires a creature to make a saving throw, the DC is determined by your Spell Save DC. <br /><br /><em><strong>Agony Totem.</strong></em> Whenever a creature moves into a space within a 30-foot radius of the totem for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it takes 1d6 necrotic damage. <br /><br /><em><strong>Bone Totem.</strong></em> You and your allies gain a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws while within a 30-foot radius of the totem. <br /><br /><em><strong>Fear Totem.</strong></em> One creature of your choice within a 30-foot radius of the totem must succeed on a Willpower saving throw or become frightened of you or an ally of your choice. You can use a bonus action on a subsequent turn of yours to attempt to frighten another creature, ending the effect on a creature already frightened by the totem. A creature frightened by the totem can make a Willpower saving throw at the end of each of their turns, ending the effect on a success. <br /><br /><em><strong>Grasping Totem.</strong></em> Whenever a creature moves into a space within a 30-foot radius of the totem for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must succeed on an Agility saving throw or become restrained. The restrained creature can make this saving throw again on the start of each of its turns. <br /><br />The totem has 20 hit points and an AC of 12 and remains for 1 hour or until its hit points are reduced to 0 or a new totem is created.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Bone_Goliath\" class=\"mw-headline\">Bone Goliath</span></h2>\n<p>At 6th level, you gain the ability to temporarily turn yourself into a guardian of bone. As a bonus action, you transform into a bone goliath, which lasts for the next minute, you use a bonus action to end it, or until you are incapacitated. You undergo the following changes while you are in your bone goliath form:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your size becomes large, unless you were larger.</li>\n<li>Your reach increases by 5 feet.</li>\n<li>You gain a number of temporary hit points equal to twice your necromancer level.

You gain a damage threshold of 5, which grants you immunity to all damage unless you take an amount of damage from a single attack or effect equal to or greater than your damage threshold, in which case you take damage as normal. Any damage that fails to meet or exceed your damage threshold is considered superficial and doesn't reduce your hit points. <br />Your damage threshold increases to 8 when you reach 17th level, and increases to 10 when you reach 20th level. <br /><br />Additionally, when you take damage from an attack you can see, you can use your reaction and expend one or more Soul Points to reduce the damage taken by 1d8 for each Soul Point used.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Last_Gasp\" class=\"mw-headline\">Last Gasp</span></h2>\nAt 18th level, when you are reduced to 0 hit points, any Soul Points that you have are immediately expended and you regain 10 hit points for each soul point expended.

You learn one exploit from the list of Master’s Exploits at the end of this subclass. These exploits allow you to enhance your fighting style. You can learn any master’s exploit, but you only gain the benefit from them if you also know the governing fighting style.</p>\n<p>You learn an additional exploit when you reach 7th level in this class (2), and again at 10th level (3), 15th level (4), and 18th level (5).

When you finish a long rest, you can spend part of that rest meditating on your training. At the end of the rest, you can replace a fighting style you know with another fighting style available to warriors. When you reach 18th level in this class, you have mastered adjusting your fighting style quickly. You can use an action to replace a fighting style you know with another fighting style available to warriors.</p>\n<p>Additionally, when you draw or stow a weapon as an action or object interaction, you can also draw or stow one additional weapon as a part of the same action.

Make a melee weapon attack. On a success, you deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Shield Charge.</strong></em> If you move at least 20-feet toward a creature in a straight line right before attacking a creature and you hit it with the attack, that target must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or be knocked prone.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Two-Weapon_Fighting\" class=\"mw-headline\">Two-Weapon Fighting</span></h2>\n<p>You can choose one of the exploits listed below, gaining its benefits if you know the Two-Weapon Fighting fighting style:</p>\n<p><em><strong>Flurry.</strong></em> When you take the Attack action and attack with a light melee weapon that you're holding in one hand, you can attack with a different light melee weapon that you're holding in the other hand twice as a bonus action instead of once.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Fast Feet.</strong></em> When you make a melee attack against a creature while holding a separate weapon in each hand, the target has disadvantage on opportunity attacks on you for the rest of the turn, whether you hit or not.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Riposte.</strong></em> When a creature misses you with a melee attack, and there are no other hostile creatures within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against the creature.

A creature that hears you speak can become plunged into fear and paranoia.</p>\n<p>If you speak to a humanoid alone for at least 10 minutes, you can attempt to seed paranoia and fear into its mind. At the end of the conversation, the target must succeed on a Willpower saving throw against your spell save DC or be frightened for the next hour, until it is attacked or damaged, or until it witnesses its allies being attacked or damaged. While frightened in this way, the target is paranoid and tries to avoid the company of others, including its allies. The target seeks out what it considers the safest, most secret place available to it and hides there.</p>\n<p>If the target succeeds on its save, the target has no hint that you tried to frighten it.</p>\n<p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short rest or long rest.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Mantle_of_Whispers\" class=\"mw-headline\">Mantle of Whispers</span></h2>\n<p>At 10th level, you gain the ability to adopt a creature’s persona. When you slay a creature with an attack or a spell or a creature dies within 5 feet of you, you can magically capture its shadow using your reaction. You can capture only the shadow of a creature that is your creature type, such as humanoid, and your size (you can capture a Small or Medium shadow if you’re Small), and you can have only one shadow captured at a time.</p>\n<p>After you capture a creature’s shadow, you can use your magic to weave it into a disguise that allows you to take on its appearance and gain access to its surface memories. As an action, you take on the creature’s appearance for 1 hour or until you end this effect as a bonus action.</p>\n<p>During that hour, you gain access to all information that the creature would freely share with a casual acquaintance. Information includes general details on its background and personal life, but does not include secrets. The information is enough that you can pass yourself off as the creature by drawing on its memories.</p>\n<p>Another creature can see through this disguise by making a Willpower (Insight) check opposed by your Personality (Deception) check, though you gain a +5 bonus to your check.</p>\n<p>The disguise and the knowledge it grants disappears when this ability’s duration ends.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Shadow_Lore\" class=\"mw-headline\">Shadow Lore</span></h2>\n<p>At 14th level, you gain the ability to weave dark magic into your words and tap into a creature’s deepest fears.</p>\n<p>As an action, you magically whisper a phrase that only one creature of your choice within 30 feet of you can hear. The target must make a Willpower saving throw against your spell save DC. It automatically succeeds if it doesn’t share a language with you or if it can’t hear you. On a successful saving throw, your whisper sounds like unintelligible mumbling and has no effect. If the target fails its saving throw, it is charmed by you for the next 8 hours or until you or your allies attack or damage it. It interprets the whispers as a description of its most mortifying secret. While you gain no knowledge of this secret, the target is convinced you know it.</p>\n<p>While charmed in this way, the creature obeys your commands for fear that you will reveal its secret. It won’t risk its life for you or fight for you, unless it was already inclined to do so. It grants you favors and gifts it would offer to a close friend.</p>\n<p>When the effect ends, the creature has no understanding of why it held you in such fear. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Basic Rules v1.4 pg 75","levels":1,"subclass":"Betrayer","hitDice":"d8","hitDiceUsed":0,"saves":["dex","int"],"skills":{"number":3,"choices":["acr","arc","ath","dec","his","ins","inv","prc","slt","ste"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"pact","ability":"cha"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"7p78eooyEyF8LXNq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_n54m2trf2bi","path":"Classes#/CF_SEP/Subclasses#/CF_SEP/Nightblade","color":"#000000"}}}

The greatsword sheds bright light in a 20- foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.<br /><br />When you attack with this weapon, you can use your Willpower modifier, instead of Strength or Agility, for the attack and damage rolls. Whenever you hit a target with your shehai, it deals force damage instead of slashing damage.<br /><br />Your shehai disappears if you let go of it. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss your shehai (no action required), or if you fall unconscious. Additionally, your shehai cannot be disarmed from you by nonmagical means.<br /><br />You can then dismiss the weapon, returning it to Aetherius, and it appears whenever you summon your shehai again.<br /><br />At 7th level, you can expend 2 stamina points to summon your shehai, granting it a +1 bonus to its attack and damage rolls. When you reach 11th level, you can expend 3 stamina points to summon your shehai, granting it a a +2 bonus to its attack and damage rolls. When you reach 17th level, you can expend 4 stamina points to summon your shehai, granting it a +3 bonus to its attack and damage rolls.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Maxims_of_the_Master\" class=\"mw-headline\">Maxims of the Master</span></h2>\n<p><em>6th, 11th, and 17th-level Spirit Sword feature</em><br /><br />You learn to master the art of the way of the blade with your shehai. You learn two sword techniques that you can use in combat. When you finish a long rest, you can exchange either of these techniques with another. You learn one additional sword technique of your choice at 11th, and again at 17th level. <br /><br />If a technique has prerequisites, you must meet them to learn it. You can learn the technique at the same time that you meet its prerequisites. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class.<br /><br /><em><strong>Break the Stone.</strong></em> No force nor object can withstand your shehai. When you hit a target with your shehai, you can expend 1 stamina point to sunder a nonmagical item or object. Instead of causing damage to a target, you can instead decrease either a target's AC, if the target is wearing armor or has a carapace, or a weapon's damage, by 1 until the start of your next turn.<br /><br /><em><strong>Dragon Stance.</strong></em> <em>(Prerequisite: 17th level)</em> When you use your bonus action to use your Patient Defense feature, and a creature within 5 feet of you misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction and spend 1 stamina point to make an attack with your shehai against that creature.<br /><br /><em><strong>Ephemeral Feint.</strong></em> As a reaction to being hit by an attack, you can expend 1 stamina point to instead phase into the Far Shores (the ethereal plane). You become resistant to all damage dealt by the attack. You immediately return back to Nirn after the attack.<br /><br /><em><strong>Furious Blows.</strong></em> <em>(Prerequisite: 17th level)</em> When you use your Flurry of Blows feature, you can make two melee weapon attacks with your shehai instead of unarmed strikes.<br /><br /><em><strong>Lengthen the Blade.</strong></em> When you make an attack with your shehai on your turn, you can expend 1 stamina point to increase your reach for that attack by 10 feet. A target you attack with this option does not gain the benefits of cover, as your blade phases through objects.<br /><br /><em><strong>Sever the Wind.</strong></em> When you use your Step of the Wind feature, if you move at least 20 feet straight toward a target, you can make one melee attack with your shehai as part of that same bonus action. This attack deals an additional 1d6 force damage upon hit. At 11th level, this attack deals an additional 2d6 force damage.<br /><br /><em><strong>Touch the Sky.</strong></em> You learn to expel a blast from your shehai. You can expend 1 stamina point to make a ranged spell attack (range 100/200 ft) using your melee weapon attack modifier for the attack roll. You use your shehai's attack damage for this ranged attack.<br /><br /><em><strong>Thousand Cuts.</strong></em> <em>(Prerequisite: 11th level)</em> When you hit a creature with your shehai, you can expend a number of stamina points to attempt to damage other creatures with the same attack. Choose a number of other creatures per stamina point expended within your reach. After-image echoes of your blade strike out at each creature that you choose. If the original attack roll would hit the other targets, they take damage equal to the damage roll.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"LGtC pg 29","levels":3,"subclass":"Way of the Spirit Sword","hitDice":"d8","hitDiceUsed":0,"saves":["str","dex"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["acr","ath","his","ins","rel","ste"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"none","ability":"wis"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"7p78eooyEyF8LXNq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_lus38e5zucb","path":"Classes#/CF_SEP/Subclasses#/CF_SEP/Monk","color":"#000000"}}}

You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature.

If the creature has an legendary or lair actions, you can't use them.</li>\n<li>When you transform, you assume the beast's hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren't knocked unconscious.</li>\n<li>You can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your breast form. Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as call lightning, that you've already cast.</li>\n<li>You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can't use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.</li>\n<li>You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it.

Many tactics enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one tactic per attack. <br /><br />You learn two additional tactics of your choice at 7th, 10th, and 15th level. Each time you learn new tactics, you can also replace one tactic you know with a different one. <br /><br /><em><strong>Tactical Dice.</strong></em> You have four tactical dice, which are d8s. A tactical die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended tactical dice when you finish a short or long rest. <br /><br />You gain another tactical die at 7th level and one more at 15th level. <br /><br /><em><strong>Saving Throws.</strong></em> Some of your tactics require your target to make a saving throw to resist the tactic’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows: <br /><br /><strong>Tactic save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Agility modifier (your choice).</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Born_Leader\" class=\"mw-headline\">Born Leader</span></h2>\n<p><em>3rd-level Legionnaire feature</em><br /><br />You gain proficiency in your choice of the Intimidation or Persuasion skill. If you are already proficient in this skill, you can choose a different skill proficiency from your warrior class list. Additionally, you can add your proficiency bonus to any skill check related to leadership, tactics, and bolstering morale.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Centurion\" class=\"mw-headline\">Centurion</span></h2>\n<p><em>7th-level Legionnaire feature</em><br /><br />As a bonus action, you can initiate a squad formation by shouting orders. For 1 minute, you and a number of creatures of your choice equal to your Personality modifier that are within 20 feet of you create a squad formation. A creature in the formation gains a bonus to Strength saving throws and Strength attribute checks equal to half your proficiency bonus, and is considered to be behind half cover. Additionally, when you move, other creatures in the formation can use a reaction to move up to half their movement speed in a direction of your choosing. <br /><br />A creature under this effect must end their turn within 10 feet of another creature in the formation, otherwise the effect ends early for it. The squad formation ends early if you are incapacitated or you die. When the effect ends for you, it ends for all creatures affected as well. <br /><br />Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"All_As_One\" class=\"mw-headline\">All As One</span></h2>\n<p><em>10th-level Legionnaire feature</em><br /><br />You can command your allies to react faster.

Upon finishing a short or long rest, choose one of your Imperial Tactics to practice with a number of creatures equal to your Personality modifier. Each of those creatures gain a single use of your chosen tactic, which uses your Tactical Dice. The creature must use this tactic before it finishes another short or long rest, or else the tactic is wasted and forgotten.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Imperial_Might\" class=\"mw-headline\">Imperial Might</span></h2>\n<p><em>18th-level Legionnaire feature</em><br /><br />You become a paragon of the might of the empire. As an action you raise a banner of the empire, bolstering the morale of your allies and increasing their power. For the next minute, you and every ally within 10 feet of you, gain a bonus to damage rolls from attacks equal to your Personality modifier.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Imperial_Tactics_2\" class=\"mw-headline\">Imperial Tactics</span></h2>\n<p>The tactics are presented in alphabetical order. <br /><br /><em><strong>Battlefield Healing.</strong></em> On your turn, you can use your action and expend one tactical die to heal an ally within 5 feet of you. It gains hit points equal to your tactical die + your Personality modifier. <br /><br /><em><strong>Challenge of Honor.</strong></em> On your turn, you can use your action and expend one tactical die to challenge a creature. The creature must succeed a Personality saving throw or it is compelled to use its reaction to move toward you, up to its movement speed. If the creature ends it’s movement 5 feet away from you, you can attack it once as part of the action, adding your tactical die to the damage roll. <br /><br />A target isn't compelled to move into an obviously deadly hazard, such as a fire or pit, but it will provoke opportunity attacks to move in the designated direction. <br /><br /><em><strong>Distracting Strike.</strong></em> When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one tactical die to distract the creature, giving your allies an opening. You add the tactical die to the attack's damage roll. The next attack roll against the target by an attacker other than you has advantage if the attack is made before the start of your next turn. <br /><br /><em><strong>Emperor’s Orders.</strong></em> When an ally that can see and hear you attacks an enemy, you can use your reaction and expend one tactical die, allowing the ally to add the tactical die to their attack roll. <br /><br /><em><strong>Legate’s Valor.</strong></em> When up to three allies that can see and hear you make saving throws to resist the frightened or charmed condition, you can use your reaction and expend one tactical die, allowing each ally to add the tactical die to their saving throw. <br /><br /><em><strong>On My Command.</strong></em> On your turn, you can use a bonus action and expend one tactical die to modify a willing creature’s position in the initiative order. The target’s current initiative increases or decreases (its choice) by the number rolled on your tactical die. <br /><br /><em><strong>Halting Attack.</strong></em> When an enemy you can see moves within reach of your melee weapon, you can use your reaction to expend one tactical die and make one weapon attack against that creature. If the attack hits, add the tactical die to the attack's damage roll and reduce the creature’s speed to 0 for the rest of the turn. <br /><br /><em><strong>Supervisor’s Advice.</strong></em> When a friendly creature who can see or hear you rolls a skill check, you can use your reaction and expend one tactical die to add it to the roll.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"LGtC pg 64","levels":3,"subclass":"Legionnaire","hitDice":"d10","hitDiceUsed":0,"saves":["str","con"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["acr","ani","ath","his","ins","itm","prc","sur"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"none","ability":"con"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"7p78eooyEyF8LXNq":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.ekJi5CDHX59W1IpP"},"cf":{"id":"temp_z83xht9qagj","path":"Classes#/CF_SEP/Subclasses#/CF_SEP/Warrior","color":"#000000"}}}

Sent forth to uplift and ease the burdens of others, heralds often see themselves as servants to the common folk and are highly regarded for their selfless acts of kindness and mercy. Even the most hopeless soul is not beyond the reach of a Herald.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Tenets_of_Heraldry\" class=\"mw-headline\">Tenets of Heraldry</span></h3>\n<p>The Devotion of Heraldry is a singular pledge of one's life to the service of their fellow man and mer alike without a thought for themselves. Crusaders of this devotion share these core tenets:</p>\n<p><em><strong>Beacon of Light.</strong></em> I will be the shining example of hope in a dark world. My actions will light the way for others.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Hope with a Smile.</strong></em> I seek to show my faith as an action and not as merely a prayer. When I serve, I do so with a smile to light up all who see me.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Ever Forward.</strong></em> I will strive to inspire others to never waver and to be a constant in the lives of those I touch.</p>\n<table class=\"uestrpgtable\"><caption>Herald Features</caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Level</th>\n<th>Feature</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3rd</td>\n<td>Devotion Spells, Channel Divinity</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7th</td>\n<td>Aura of the Aegis, Divine Smite: Psychic</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15th</td>\n<td>Divine Ward</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20th</td>\n<td>Divine Emissary</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2><span id=\"Devotion_Spells\" class=\"mw-headline\">Devotion Spells</span></h2>\n<p><em>3rd-level Herald feature</em></p>\n<p>You gain devotion spells at the crusader levels listed in the Zealot’s Devotion Spells table.

Many tactics enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one tactic per attack.</p>\n<p>You learn two additional tactics of your choice at 7th, 10th, and 15th level. Each time you learn new tactics, you can also replace one tactic you know with a different one.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Tactical Dice.</strong></em> You have four tactical dice, which are d8s. A tactical die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended tactical dice when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<p>You gain another tactical die at 7th level and one more at 15th level.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Saving Throws.</strong></em> Some of your tactics require your target to make a saving throw to resist the tactic’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd><strong>Tactic save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Agility modifier (your choice)</dd>\n</dl>\n<h2><span id=\"Defender's_Sacrifice\"></span><span id=\"Defender.27s_Sacrifice\" class=\"mw-headline\">Defender's Sacrifice</span></h2>\n<p>Starting at 7th level, when a creature you can see damages a target other than you that is withing 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to take the blow instead. This damage to you can't be reduced or prevented in any way.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Additional_Defensive_Style\" class=\"mw-headline\">Additional Defensive Style</span></h2>\n<p>At 10th level, you choose an additional Defensive Style. You can't choose the same Defensive Style twice.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Bulwark\" class=\"mw-headline\">Bulwark</span></h2>\n<p>Beginning at 15th level, you can extend the benefit of your Indomitable feature to an ally. When use your Indomitable feature to reroll a saving throw and you aren't incapacitated, you can choose one ally within 60 feet of you that also failed its saving throw against the same effect. If that creature can see or hear you, it can reroll its saving throw and must use the new roll.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Survivor\" class=\"mw-headline\">Survivor</span></h2>\n<p>At 18th level, you attain the pinnacle of resilience in battle. At the start of each of your turns, you regain hit points equal to 5 + your Endurance modifier if you have no more than half your hit points left. You don't gain this benefit if you have 0 hit points.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Defensive_Tactics_2\" class=\"mw-headline\">Defensive Tactics</span></h2>\n<p>The tactics are presented in alphabetical order.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Disarming Attack.</strong></em> When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one tactical die to attempt to disarm the target, forcing it to drop one item of your choice that it's holding. You add the tactical die to the attack's damage roll, and the target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it drops the object you choose. The object lands at its feet.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Evasive footwork.</strong></em> When you move, you can expend one tactical die, rolling a tactical die and adding the number rolled to your AC until you stop moving.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Goading Attack.</strong></em> When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one tactical die to attempt to goad the target into attacking you. You add the tactical die to the attack's damage roll, and the target must make a Willpower saving throw. On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on all attack rolls against targets other than you until the end of your next turn.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Maneuvering Attack.</strong></em> When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one tactical die to maneuver one of your comrades into a more advantageous position. You add the tactical die to the attack's damage roll, and you choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you. That creature can use it's reaction to move up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks from the target of your attack.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Parry.</strong></em> When another creature damages you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction and expend one tactical die to reduce the damage by the number you roll on your tactical die + your Agility modifier.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Power Bash.</strong></em> When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one tactical die to attempt to throw the attacker off balance. You add the tactical die roll to the attack's damage roll, and it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it is staggered and has disadvantage on their next attack.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Pushing Attack.</strong></em> When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one tactical die to attempt to drive the target back. You add the tactical die roll to the attack's damage roll, and if the target is Large or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it is pushed back 15 feet.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Rally.</strong></em> On your turn, you can use a bonus action and expend one tactical die to bolster the resolve of one of your companions. When you do so, choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you. That creature gains temporary hit points equal to the tactical die roll + your Personality modifier.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Shield Wall.</strong></em> When another creature attacks you, you can use your reaction and expend one tactical die to increase your AC by the number you roll on your tactical die, until the start of your next turn.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Trip Attack.</strong></em> When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one tactical die to attempt to knock the target down. You add the tactical die to the attack's damage roll, and if the target is Large or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you knock the target prone.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Basic Rules v1.4 pg 119","levels":3,"subclass":"Defense","hitDice":"d10","hitDiceUsed":0,"saves":["str","con"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["acr","ani","ath","his","ins","itm","prc","sur"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"none","ability":"con"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"7p78eooyEyF8LXNq":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.ekJi5CDHX59W1IpP"},"cf":{"id":"temp_z83xht9qagj","path":"Classes#/CF_SEP/Subclasses#/CF_SEP/Warrior","color":"#000000"}}}

Centuries ago, the Direnni mages and sorcerers formalized many of the rituals, chants, and incantations that are still used today.</p>\n<p>When a mage uses conjuration magic, they create a connection from their mind to the summoned entity. It is a tenuous link, meant to lure, hold, and dismiss, but in the hand of a master, it becomes much stronger.</p>\n<p>Detractors of conjuration believe that the pursuit of summoning and control is desperate and dangerous, however, conjurers understand the risks of their power. As a mage of the School of Conjuration, you have learned how to summon powerful elemental daedra to serve as guardians and protectors, and sometimes as servants and familiars. Unlike the unpredictable dremora, the nonbelligerent atronachs are much more reliable servants, as they are not aligned with any daedric prince.</p>\n<p><strong>School of Conjuration Features </strong></p>\n<table class=\"uestrpgtable\"><caption> </caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Level</th>\n<th>Feature</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2nd</td>\n<td>Conjuration Prodigy, Minor Conjuration, Atromancer</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6th</td>\n<td>Elemental Bond</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10th</td>\n<td>Focused Conjuration</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14th</td>\n<td>Elemental Soul</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2><span id=\"Conjuration_Prodigy\" class=\"mw-headline\">Conjuration Prodigy</span></h2>\n<p>Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to learn a conjuration spell is halved.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Minor_Conjuration\" class=\"mw-headline\">Minor Conjuration</span></h2>\n<p>Starting at 2nd level when you select this school, you can use your action to conjure up an inanimate object in your hand or on the ground in an unoccupied space that you can see within 10 feet of you.

On a success, this effect ends. <br /><br />At 10th level, you can target two creatures instead of one with this feature, and you can target three creatures when you reach 18th level.

This art breaches the world that most inhabitants of Tamriel are familiar with, through calling upon the dark energies to bring the destruction of the void through, or by crossing between the two to hide in the shadows.

You also gain proficiency in the Stealth or Survival skill (your choice).</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Channel_Darkness\" class=\"mw-headline\">Channel Darkness</span></h2>\n<p><em>2nd-level Voidkeeper feature</em><br /><br />You gain the ability to channel dark energy directly from the Void, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You can use an unholy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your necromancer spells and your Channel Darkness effects. You start with two such effects: <strong>Bind Undead</strong> and <strong>Marked for Death</strong>. <br /><br />When you use your Channel Darkness, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Darkness again. Some Channel Darkness effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your necromancer spell save DC. <br /><br />Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Darkness twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Channel_Darkness:_Bind_Undead\" class=\"mw-headline\">Channel Darkness: Bind Undead</span></h3>\n<p>As an action, you present your unholy focus and speak a command that binds undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet and has a CR equal to or lower than your proficiency bonus must make a Willpower saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is charmed by you for 10 minutes and will follow your spoken commands to the best of its abilities.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Channel_Darkness:_Marked_for_Death\" class=\"mw-headline\">Channel Darkness: Marked for Death</span></h3>\n<p>As an action, you present your unholy symbol and speak a damning word at a humanoid of your choosing within 30 feet of you that can see or hear you. The target must make a Willpower saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, its AC is reduced by a number equal to half your proficiency bonus (rounded down), and the creature takes 1d4 necrotic damage at the start of each of its turns for the next minute. When you reach 6th level, the damage increases to 2d4, and it increases again at 18th level to 3d4.</p>\n<p>Only one creature can be marked for death in this manner at a time. Using this feature again ends the previous mark. A creature can repeat this save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect upon a success.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Quiet_Casting\" class=\"mw-headline\">Quiet Casting</span></h2>\n<p><em>6th-level Voidkeeper feature</em><br /><br />You learn to infuse silence into your spellcasting. When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 Soul Point to cast it without a verbal component.</p>\n<p>When you cast a spell that deals damage in this manner, and target a single creature that is unaware or surprised, instead of rolling for damage, you deal the maximum amount of the dice.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Cloak_of_the_Void\" class=\"mw-headline\">Cloak of the Void</span></h2>\n<p><em>14th-level Voidkeeper feature</em><br /><br />When you are reduced to 0 hit points, but not killed outright, you can use your reaction to be cloaked in the dark energies of the Void, dropping to 1 hit point instead. You then gain immunity to all damage until the start of your next turn.</p>\n<p>Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Dark_Guardian\" class=\"mw-headline\">Dark Guardian</span></h2>\n<p><em>18th-level Voidkeeper feature</em><br /><br />Whenever a living creature hits you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to expend a Soul Point to summon a skeletal dark guardian to interpose on your behalf. The dark guardian's AC is 12 + your Proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier. If the attack roll would still hit, the damage dealt to you is reduced by half. If the attack roll is lower than the dark guardian’s AC, the attack deals no damage and the dark guardian can immediately make a melee attack against that creature. The dark guardian’s attack roll bonus is equal to your spell attack modifier and deals bludgeoning damage equal to 3d6 + your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<p>Regardless if the initial attack hits or misses, the dark guardian then disappears.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"LGtC pg 33","levels":2,"subclass":"Voidkeeper","hitDice":"d8","hitDiceUsed":0,"saves":[],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","dec","his","itm","med","nat","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"int"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"7p78eooyEyF8LXNq":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.poHWQdLb44Dq42w8"},"cf":{"id":"temp_2uh0nomkcz4","path":"Classes#/CF_SEP/Subclasses#/CF_SEP/Necromancer","color":"#000000"}}}
