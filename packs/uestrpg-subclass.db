When a creature you can see moves into a space within 10 feet of you or starts its turn there, you can use your reaction to spread a disease that you know, forcing the creature to make an Endurance saving throw. The DC for the saving throw is equal to your spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature suffers the effects of the chosen disease for the next 10 minutes. If more than one creature starts its turn within 10 feet of you, you can choose which creature to spread the disease to. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to this disease for the next 24 hours.

The corpse or creature explodes in a burst of disease, forcing each creature within 10 feet of it to make an Endurance saving throw. On a failed save, each creature takes 2d8 necrotic damage for each Soul Point expended and they are infected with the same disease the creature was infected with.

Roll a number of d4’s equal to half of your proficiency bonus (rounded down) and add this total to the damage dealt.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Bloodletter\" class=\"mw-headline\">Bloodletter</span></h2>\n<p><em>6th-level Sanguine Puppetry feature</em><br /><br />When a creature within 30 feet of you is harmed by bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, and the target isn't a construct, plant, or an undead, you can use your reaction to magically siphon a portion of their blood in order to empower yourself until the end of your next turn. While empowered this way, the first time you hit a target with an attack, you deal an extra 1d8 necrotic damage to that attack. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Sanguinating_Marionette\" class=\"mw-headline\">Sanguinating Marionette</span></h2>\n<p><em>14th-level Sanguine Puppetry feature</em><br /><br />You can use a bonus action to expend a Soul Point to control the movement of one living creature that you can see within 30 feet of you, provided that the creature has blood and it’s below its hit point maximum. The creature must succeed on a Personality saving throw against your spell save DC or use its reaction to move up to 30 feet in a direction of your choice. The creature can then make a melee attack against a creature of your choice as part of this reaction. You can’t use this feature again until after you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Magicka_Transfusion\" class=\"mw-headline\">Magicka Transfusion</span></h2>\n<p><em>14th-level Sanguine Puppetry feature</em><br /><br />You learn to draw on the innate magical potential within your own blood in order to fuel your spells.</p>\n<p>When you cast a necromancer spell of 1st-level or higher, you can expend a number of hit dice equal to the spell’s level to cast the spell without expending magicka.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Hemophilic_Resurgence\" class=\"mw-headline\">Hemophilic Resurgence</span></h2>\n<em>18th-level Sanguine Puppetry feature</em><br /><br />Your mastery of blood magic allows you to better harm your foes. When you roll a 1 on a damage die that deals necrotic damage, you can expend 1 Soul Point to add your Intelligence modifier to that die. You can add this extra damage to a number of damage dice equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1) for that spell.</div>\n</div>\n</div>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Enemies of Elsweyr pg 10","levels":2,"subclass":"Sanguine Puppetry","hitDice":"d8","hitDiceUsed":0,"saves":[],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","dec","his","itm","med","nat","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"int"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"7p78eooyEyF8LXNq":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.poHWQdLb44Dq42w8"},"cf":{"id":"temp_2hzqnpg3c6h","color":"#000000"}}}

Being immersed in new cultures and always surrounding themselves with new ideas keeps their minds and hearts open.</p>\n<p>They are well-versed in tomes of old, and get through life by bartering in the market or persuading the weak-minded. Pilgrims are naturally charismatic and their travels bring fascinating stories to tell. Their journeys can also bring out a nefarious side. The inability to lay down roots and build long lasting relationships can cause a person to grow cold and self-indulgent. Some pilgrims find themselves akin to snake-oil salesmen, profiting off of scams or deceit before moving on to the next mark.</p>\n<p>A priest with this calling might follow Baan Dar, Clavicus Vile, Dibella, Sanguine, Sheogorath, St. Veloth, Vivec, Zenithar.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Pilgrim Features</strong></p>\n<table class=\"uestrpgtable\"><caption> </caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Level</th>\n<th>Feature</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1st</td>\n<td>Calling Spells, Bonus Proficiencies, Eye for Danger</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2nd</td>\n<td>Channel Divinity: Gathered Secrets</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6th</td>\n<td>Deceit and Influence, Wayfarer’s Path</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8th</td>\n<td>Divine Strike</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17th</td>\n<td>Eye for Weak Points</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2><span id=\"Calling_Spells\" class=\"mw-headline\">Calling Spells</span></h2>\n<p><em>1st-level Pilgrim Calling feature</em></p>\n<p>You gain calling spells at the priest levels listed in the Pilgrim Calling Spells table.

Crier</a> is a spiritual journey, as the barbarian learns to channel their life essence through their voice and breath. War Criers are rare in barbarian tribes, but those who have the gift are usually put into positions of power, either as shaman, spiritual leaders, or chieftains.</p>\n<p>Most <a title=\"Nord\" href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/Nord\">Nords</a> have some innate capacity for the power of the <a class=\"extiw\" title=\"uesp:Lore:Thu'um\" href=\"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Thu%27um\">Voice</a>, believing that their breath holds their vital essence. The other races can learn how to wield such power, but may require greater study, perhaps spending time with powerful Tongues.</p>\n<p><strong>Path of the War Crier Features</strong></p>\n<table class=\"uestrpgtable\"><caption> </caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Level</th>\n<th>Feature</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3rd</td>\n<td>Battle Thu'um, Draconic Tongue, Dragon Shouts (2)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6th</td>\n<td>Shout Resistance, Wrathful Shouts, Dragon Shouts (4)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10th</td>\n<td>Destructive Shouts, Draconic Rage, Dragon Shouts (6)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14th</td>\n<td>Thu'um Master, Dragon Shouts (8)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2><span id=\"Battle_Thu.27um\" class=\"mw-headline\">Battle Thu'um</span></h2>\n<p><em>3rd-level Path of the War Crier feature</em><br />You learn how to harness the power of the dragon tongue to form powerful shouts. A shout requires you to spend shout points each time you use one.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Shouts.</strong></em> You know the <em>Unrelenting Force</em> shout and two other shouts of your choice, which are detailed in the <strong>“Dragon Shouts”</strong> section at the end of the subclass description. You learn two additional shouts of your choice at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</p>\n<p>Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the dragon shouts you know and replace it with another dragon shout that you could learn at that level.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Shout Points.</strong></em> You have 2 shout points and you regain any expended shout points when you finish a short or long rest. Additionally, you regain 1 shout point when you enter your rage.</p>\n<p>You gain two additional shout points at 6th level (4), and again at 10th level (6), and 14th level (8).</p>\n<p><em><strong>Using Words of Power.</strong></em> The Thu’um is a form of magic that uses words of power from the draconic language to form powerful shouts. While the effects of a dragon shout are considered spells, they break some of the rules of spellcasting:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can use shouts even while raging.</li>\n<li>You require the ability to speak to be able to use a dragon shout.</li>\n<li>You do not require to use somatic or material components to cast spells as a dragon shout.</li>\n<li>Dragon shouts that create spells or effects that have a duration longer than instantaneous do not require concentration to maintain. You can only have one effect active at a time and any effects immediately end if you are incapacitated or cast another shout with a duration longer than instantaneous.</li>\n<li>You can only use one shout on each turn.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some dragon shouts require the target to make a saving throw to resist its effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>\n<p><strong>Dragon Shout save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Endurance modifier</p>\n<p>Once you reach 6th level in this class, you can spend additional shout points to increase the power of a shout that you cast, provided that it has an enhanced effect, as Unrelenting Force does.</p>\n<p>The maximum number of shout points you can spend to cast a shout in this way (including its base shout point cost and any additional shout points you spend to increase its effect) is determined by your barbarian level, as shown in the Maximum Shout Points table below.</p>\n<p><strong>Maximum Shout Points</strong></p>\n<table class=\"uestrpgtable\"><caption> </caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Barbarian Level</th>\n<th>Max. Shout Points for a Shout</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6th-8th</td>\n<td>3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9th-12th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13th-16th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17th-20th</td>\n<td>6</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2><span id=\"Draconic_Tongue\" class=\"mw-headline\">Draconic Tongue</span></h2>\n<p><em>3rd-level Path of the War Crier feature</em><br />You gain mastery with draconic words. You are now proficient in the <a class=\"extiw\" title=\"uesp:Lore:Dragon Language\" href=\"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Dragon_Language\">Dovahzul</a> language.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Shout_Resistance\" class=\"mw-headline\">Shout Resistance</span></h2>\n<p><em>6th-level Path of the War Crier feature</em><br />Your knowledge of the Thu’um has made you resistant to it. You have advantage on all saving throws made against shouts.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Wrathful_Shouts\" class=\"mw-headline\">Wrathful Shouts</span></h2>\n<p><em>6th-level Path of the War Crier feature</em><br />When you deal damage with a shout while raging, you add the damage bonus of your rage to one of the damage rolls.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Destructive_Shouts\" class=\"mw-headline\">Destructive Shouts</span></h2>\n<p><em>10th-level Path of the War Crier feature</em><br />You can focus on your shouts, making them deadlier by lowering your guard. Once on your turn when you cast a shout that requires a saving throw you can give one target disadvantage against the shout’s saving throw, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Draconic_Rage\" class=\"mw-headline\">Draconic Rage</span></h2>\n<p><em>10th-level Path of the War Crier feature</em><br />When you use a bonus action to enter into a rage, you can cast a dragon shout as part of the bonus action.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Thu’um_Master\"></span><span id=\"Thu.E2.80.99um_Master\" class=\"mw-headline\">Thu’um Master</span></h2>\n<p><em>14th-level Path of the War Crier feature</em><br />When you use your action to cast a dragon shout, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action. Additionally, when you enter your rage you recover 2 shout points, instead of 1.</p>\n<h1><span id=\"Dragon_Shouts\" class=\"mw-headline\">Dragon Shouts</span></h1>\n<p>The dragon shouts are presented in alphabetical order. If a shout has prerequisites, you must meet them to learn it. You can learn the shout at the same time that you meet its prerequisites.

They tell of the parable of a person struck with the blunt side of a plate. The person is left with a small bruise, but is otherwise left unharmed. However, if the plate is broken, and the person is struck with one of the shards, the person may be grievously wounded. This is the first essential point of the <a class=\"extiw\" title=\"uesp:Lore:Way of the Exposed Palm\" href=\"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Way_of_the_Exposed_Palm\">Way of the Exposed Palm</a>.</p>\n<p>Each finger on the hand represents a fundamental belief: concentration, reaction, equilibrium, speed, and breath control. To truly become a master of the Exposed Palm, one must perfect all five digits.</p>\n<p>In the parable of the plate, it tells the story of the first aspect of concentration.

href=\"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:High_Hrothgar\">High Hrothgar</a> are the most famous practitioners of the <a class=\"mw-selflink selflink\">Way of the Voice</a>. These philosophical monks, known as the <a class=\"extiw\" title=\"uesp:Lore:Greybeards\" href=\"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Greybeards\">Greybeards</a>, spend most of their time in silent meditation, isolated atop Skyrim's largest mountain, the <a class=\"extiw\" title=\"uesp:Lore:Throat of the World\" href=\"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Throat_of_the_World\">Throat of the World</a>.</p>\n<p>The Greybeards believe in using the <a class=\"extiw\" title=\"uesp:Lore:Way of the Voice\" href=\"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Way_of_the_Voice\">Voice</a> to attain enlightenment, rather than as a tool of war. This doesn't mean that they teach pacifism, only that the Voice can be used more more than just simple violence. They believe that those who can wield the Voice should only do so in times of true need.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Way of the Voice Features</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<table class=\"uestrpgtable\"><caption> </caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Level</th>\n<th>Feature</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3rd</td>\n<td>Discipline of the Voice, Minor Thu'um, Dragon Shouts (2)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6th</td>\n<td>Passage of Knowledge, Dragon Shouts (4)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11th</td>\n<td>Speed of 7,000 Steps, Dragon Shouts (6)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17th</td>\n<td>Might of the Tongues, Dragon Shouts (8)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2><span id=\"Discipline_of_the_Voice\" class=\"mw-headline\">Discipline of the Voice</span></h2>\n<p><em>3rd-level Way of the Voice feature</em><br />You learn how to harness the power of the dragon tongue to form powerful shouts. A shout requires you to spend stamina points each time you use one. When you use a shout that requires you to expend 2 stamina points or less, you can choose not to expend any stamina points a number of times equal to half your proficiency bonus (rounded up). Once you use a shout in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Shouts.</strong></em> You know the <em>Unrelenting Force</em> shout and two other shouts of your choice, which are detailed in the <strong>“Dragon Shouts”</strong> section at the end of the subclass description. You learn two additional shouts of your choice at 6th, 11th, and 17th level. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the dragon shouts you know and replace it with another dragon shout that you could learn at that level.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Using Words of Power.</strong></em> The Thu'um is a form of magic which uses words from the <a class=\"extiw\" title=\"uesp:Lore:Dragon Language\" href=\"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Dragon_Language\">draconic</a> language to form powerful shouts. While the effects of a dragon shout are considered spells, they break some of the rules of spellcasting:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You require the ability to speak to be able to use a dragon shout.</li>\n<li>You do not require to use somatic or material components to cast spells as a dragon shout.</li>\n<li>Dragon shouts that create spells or effects that have a duration longer than instantaneous do not require concentration to maintain. You can only have one effect active at a time and any effects immediately end if you are incapacitated or cast another shout with a duration longer than instantaneous.</li>\n<li>You can only use one shout on each turn.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You use your Stamina save DC for any shouts or spells that require a saving throw to resist its effects. Once you reach 5th level in this class, you can spend additional stamina points to increase the power of a shout that you cast, provided that it has an enhanced effect, as Unrelenting Force does. The maximum number of stamina points you can spend to cast a shout in this way (including its base stamina point cost and any additional stamina points you spend to increase its effect) is determined by your monk level, as shown in the Maximum Shout Points table below.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Maximum Shout Points</p>\n<p> </p>\n<table class=\"uestrpgtable\"><caption> </caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Monk Level</th>\n<th>Max.

You gain a new attack option that you can use with the Attack action. This special attack is a ranged spell attack with a range of 30 feet. You are proficient with it, and you add your Willpower modifier to its attack and damage rolls. Its damage is force, and its damage die is a d4. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table. This special attack is considered a monk weapon for you. When you gain the Extra Attack feature, this special attack can be used for any of the attacks you make as part of the Attack action.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Passage_of_Knowledge\" class=\"mw-headline\">Passage of Knowledge</span></h2>\n<p><em>6th-level Way of the Voice feature</em><br />Your understanding of the voice allows you to temporarily teach it to others. As an action, you whisper one of the dragon shouts you know to a creature within 5 feet of you that can speak and knows at least one language, filling its mind with the words of power. That creature can use this shout using your Stamina save DC once before it finishes a long rest. You expend stamina points for the shout as normal. You cannot spend more than 3 stamina points to use this feature. Once the shout is used, the knowledge of it vanishes from the creature’s mind. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Speed_of_the_7,000_Steps\"></span><span id=\"Speed_of_the_7.2C000_Steps\" class=\"mw-headline\">Speed of the 7,000 Steps</span></h2>\n<p><em>11th-level Way of the Voice feature</em><br />Your understanding of the Thu’um allows you to combine it with your martial arts. When you use a Dragon Shout, you can make an unarmed strike or use Flurry of Blows, as if you had used a monk weapon or an unarmed strike. In addition, you may use your Minor Thu’um feature as a bonus action after attacking with a monk weapon or an unarmed strike.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Might_of_the_Tongues\" class=\"mw-headline\">Might of the Tongues</span></h2>\n<p><em>17th-level Way of the Voice feature</em><br />You can tap deep into your knowledge of the voice to destroy your enemies in times of true need. When you use a Dragon Shout without expending any stamina points, treat the shout as if you had spent 3 stamina points.</p>\n<h1><span id=\"Dragon_Shouts\" class=\"mw-headline\">Dragon Shouts</span></h1>\n<p>The dragon shouts are presented in alphabetical order. If a shout has prerequisites, you must meet them to learn it. You can learn the shout at the same time that you meet its prerequisites. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Animal_Allegiance_(Raan_Mir_Tah)\"></span><span id=\"Animal_Allegiance_.28Raan_Mir_Tah.29\" class=\"mw-headline\">Animal Allegiance (Raan Mir Tah)</span></h3>\n<p><em>Prerequisite: 6th level</em><br />As an action, You can spend 2 shout points to summon beasts of the wild.

The number of creatures that appear is twice as many if you spend 2 additional shout points, three times as many with 3 additional shout points, and four times as many with 4 additional shout points.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Aura_Whisper_(Laas_Yah_Nir)\"></span><span id=\"Aura_Whisper_.28Laas_Yah_Nir.29\" class=\"mw-headline\">Aura Whisper (Laas Yah Nir)</span></h3>\n<p>As an action, you can spend 1 shout point to whisper a short phrase, revealing all life forces to yourself, as though you had cast the <a title=\"New Spells\" href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/New_Spells\"><em>detect life</em></a> spell. The range increases by 10 feet for each additional shout point you spend.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Battle_Fury_(Mid_Vur_Shaan)\"></span><span id=\"Battle_Fury_.28Mid_Vur_Shaan.29\" class=\"mw-headline\">Battle Fury (Mid Vur Shaan)</span></h3>\n<p><em>Prerequisite: 6th level</em><br />As a bonus action, you can spend 1 shout point to enchant your allies’ weapons, allowing them to make a quick attack. One creature of your choice that is within 30 feet of you can immediately use their reaction to make a weapon attack.</p>\n<p>One additional creature within 30 feet of you can use their reaction to make a weapon attack for each additional shout point you spend.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Become_Ethereal_(Feim_Zii_Gron)\"></span><span id=\"Become_Ethereal_.28Feim_Zii_Gron.29\" class=\"mw-headline\">Become Ethereal (Feim Zii Gron)</span></h3>\n<p><em>Prerequisite: 11th level</em><br />As an action, you can spend 3 stamina points to speak to the void, changing your form.

The spirit is considered to be a Celestial and it disappears after 1 minute, when it drops to 0 hit points, or if you become unconscious.</p>\n<p>The summoned spirit is friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the spirit, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue it (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any commands to the spirit, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions. See this creature’s game statistics in the Valiant Warrior stat block (Enemies of Elsweyr), but you add your level to its hit points and half your proficiency bonus to its attack roll and damage roll.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Clear_Skies_(Lok_Vah_Koor)\"></span><span id=\"Clear_Skies_.28Lok_Vah_Koor.29\" class=\"mw-headline\">Clear Skies (Lok Vah Koor)</span></h3>\n<p>As an action, you can spend 1 shout point to use your voice to dispel any natural or magical inclement weather that you can see within 1 mile, forcing only clear skies to remain.

A creature must repeat this save when it comes within 5 feet of the cyclone for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.</p>\n<p>As a bonus action, you can move the cyclone up to 30 feet in any direction.

The cyclone ends after one minute, if you end it as an action or if you are incapacitated.</p>\n<p>The damage increases by 1d8 for each additional shout point you spend.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Disarm_(Zun_Haal_Viik)\"></span><span id=\"Disarm_.28Zun_Haal_Viik.29\" class=\"mw-headline\">Disarm (Zun Haal Viik)</span></h3>\n<p><em>Prerequisite: 6th level</em><br />As an action, you use 2 shout points to create a shout that defies matter. One creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature drops one object of your choice it is holding in its hands and the object lands at a point of your choosing within 15 feet of the target. On a successful save, the creature continues to hold on to the objects in their hands, but they have disadvantage on any rolls made using the object, such as weapon attacks, until the end of their next turn.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Dismay_(Faas_Ru_Maar)\"></span><span id=\"Dismay_.28Faas_Ru_Maar.29\" class=\"mw-headline\">Dismay (Faas Ru Maar)</span></h3>\n<p><em>Prerequisite: 10th level</em><br />As an action, you can spend 2 shout points to speak a force of terror.

One creature of your choice that you can see within 90 feet of you must succeed on an Endurance saving throw or take 4d8 cold damage and be encased in a shell of ice. The encased creature is immobilized and can't speak, hear, move, or take any actions. The creature takes this damage again at the start of its turn while encased. The creature restrained by this spell must make another Endurance saving throw at the end of each of their turns to try and break free. If it successfully saves against this effect three times, the effect ends. If it fails its save three times, the frost hardens and the creature is subjected to the frozen condition. The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind.</p>\n<p>While the effect is active, the frost shell has an AC of 10 and has 30 hit points.

This indifference ends if the target is attacked or harmed by a spell or if it witnesses any of its allies being harmed. The creature becomes hostile again after 1 minute, unless the DM rules otherwise. The duration increases by 1 minute for each additional shout point you spend.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Marked_for_Death_(Krii_Lun_Aus)\"></span><span id=\"Marked_for_Death_.28Krii_Lun_Aus.29\" class=\"mw-headline\">Marked for Death (Krii Lun Aus)</span></h3>\n<p>As a bonus action, you can spend 1 shout point to mark a creature as though you cast the <a class=\"extiw\" title=\"dndbeyond:spells/hunters-mark\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/hunters-mark\"><em>hunter’s mark</em></a> spell at 1st level.

The illusion appears in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you. The illusion looks exactly like you; it is silent; it is your size, is insubstantial, and doesn’t occupy its space; and it is unaffected by attacks and damage.

Additionally, when both you and your illusion are within 5 feet of a creature that can see the illusion, you have advantage on attack rolls against that creature, given how uncanny the illusion is.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Poison Strike.</strong></em> You can use your Channel Divinity to make a weapon deadlier. As a bonus action, you touch one weapon or piece of ammunition and conjure a special poison on it. The poison lasts for 1 minute. The next time you hit a target with an attack using that weapon or ammunition, the target takes poison damage immediately after the attack. The poison damage equals 2d10 + your crusader level, or 20 + your crusader level if you had advantage on the attack roll.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Aura_of_Treachery\" class=\"mw-headline\">Aura of Treachery</span></h2>\n<p>Starting at 7th level, you emanate an aura of discord, which gives you the following benefits.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Cull the Herd.</strong></em> You have advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature that has one or more of its allies within 5 feet of it.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Treacherous Strike.</strong></em> If a creature within 5 feet of you misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to force the attacker to reroll that attack against a creature of your choice that is also within 5 feet of the attacker. The ability fails and is wasted if the attacker is immune to being charmed. You can use this ability three times, and regain expended uses of it when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Divine_Smite:_Poison\" class=\"mw-headline\">Divine Smite: Poison</span></h2>\n<p>Also at 7th level, whenever you use the Divine Smite feature, you can choose to infuse your weapon strikes with poison damage instead of lightning.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Blackguard's_Escape\"></span><span id=\"Blackguard.27s_Escape\" class=\"mw-headline\">Blackguard's Escape</span></h2>\n<p>At 15th level, you have the ability to slip away from your foes. Immediately after you are hit by an attack, you can use your reaction to turn invisible and teleport up to 60 feet to a spot you can see. You remain invisible until the end of your next turn or until you attack, deal damage, or force a creature to make a saving throw.</p>\n<p>Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Icon_of_Deceit\" class=\"mw-headline\">Icon of Deceit</span></h2>\n<p>At 20th level, you gain the ability to emanate feelings of treachery. As an action, you can magically become an avatar of deceit, gaining the following benefits for 1 minute:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You are invisible.</li>\n<li>If a creature damages you on its turn, it must succeed on a Willpower saving throw (DC equal to your spell save DC) or you control its next action, provided that you aren’t incapacitated when it takes the action.

As a bonus action on your turn, you can use a corpse of a small or larger creature that you can see and transform it into a totem of your choice. The totem is created in a location that you can see within 30 feet of you. The corpse that is used to create the totem is destroyed and can't be used again. If a totem requires a creature to make a saving throw, the DC is determined by your Spell Save DC. <br /><br /><em><strong>Agony Totem.</strong></em> Whenever a creature moves into a space within a 30-foot radius of the totem for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it takes 1d6 necrotic damage. <br /><br /><em><strong>Bone Totem.</strong></em> You and your allies gain a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws while within a 30-foot radius of the totem. <br /><br /><em><strong>Fear Totem.</strong></em> One creature of your choice within a 30-foot radius of the totem must succeed on a Willpower saving throw or become frightened of you or an ally of your choice. You can use a bonus action on a subsequent turn of yours to attempt to frighten another creature, ending the effect on a creature already frightened by the totem. A creature frightened by the totem can make a Willpower saving throw at the end of each of their turns, ending the effect on a success. <br /><br /><em><strong>Grasping Totem.</strong></em> Whenever a creature moves into a space within a 30-foot radius of the totem for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must succeed on an Agility saving throw or become restrained. The restrained creature can make this saving throw again on the start of each of its turns. <br /><br />The totem has 20 hit points and an AC of 12 and remains for 1 hour or until its hit points are reduced to 0 or a new totem is created.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Bone_Goliath\" class=\"mw-headline\">Bone Goliath</span></h2>\n<p>At 6th level, you gain the ability to temporarily turn yourself into a guardian of bone. As a bonus action, you transform into a bone goliath, which lasts for the next minute, you use a bonus action to end it, or until you are incapacitated. You undergo the following changes while you are in your bone goliath form:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your size becomes large, unless you were larger.</li>\n<li>Your reach increases by 5 feet.</li>\n<li>You gain a number of temporary hit points equal to twice your necromancer level.

You gain a damage threshold of 5, which grants you immunity to all damage unless you take an amount of damage from a single attack or effect equal to or greater than your damage threshold, in which case you take damage as normal. Any damage that fails to meet or exceed your damage threshold is considered superficial and doesn't reduce your hit points. <br />Your damage threshold increases to 8 when you reach 17th level, and increases to 10 when you reach 20th level. <br /><br />Additionally, when you take damage from an attack you can see, you can use your reaction and expend one or more Soul Points to reduce the damage taken by 1d8 for each Soul Point used.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Last_Gasp\" class=\"mw-headline\">Last Gasp</span></h2>\nAt 18th level, when you are reduced to 0 hit points, any Soul Points that you have are immediately expended and you regain 10 hit points for each soul point expended.

Centuries ago, the Direnni mages and sorcerers formalized many of the rituals, chants, and incantations that are still used today.</p>\n<p>When a mage uses conjuration magic, they create a connection from their mind to the summoned entity. It is a tenuous link, meant to lure, hold, and dismiss, but in the hand of a master, it becomes much stronger.</p>\n<p>Detractors of conjuration believe that the pursuit of summoning and control is desperate and dangerous, however, conjurers understand the risks of their power. As a mage of the School of Conjuration, you have learned how to summon powerful elemental daedra to serve as guardians and protectors, and sometimes as servants and familiars. Unlike the unpredictable dremora, the nonbelligerent atronachs are much more reliable servants, as they are not aligned with any daedric prince.</p>\n<p><strong>School of Conjuration Features </strong></p>\n<table class=\"uestrpgtable\"><caption> </caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Level</th>\n<th>Feature</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2nd</td>\n<td>Conjuration Prodigy, Minor Conjuration, Atromancer</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6th</td>\n<td>Elemental Bond</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10th</td>\n<td>Focused Conjuration</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14th</td>\n<td>Elemental Soul</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2><span id=\"Conjuration_Prodigy\" class=\"mw-headline\">Conjuration Prodigy</span></h2>\n<p>Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to learn a conjuration spell is halved.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Minor_Conjuration\" class=\"mw-headline\">Minor Conjuration</span></h2>\n<p>Starting at 2nd level when you select this school, you can use your action to conjure up an inanimate object in your hand or on the ground in an unoccupied space that you can see within 10 feet of you.

You also gain proficiency in the Stealth or Survival skill (your choice).</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Channel_Darkness\" class=\"mw-headline\">Channel Darkness</span></h2>\n<p><em>2nd-level Voidkeeper feature</em><br /><br />You gain the ability to channel dark energy directly from the Void, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You can use an unholy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your necromancer spells and your Channel Darkness effects. You start with two such effects: <strong>Bind Undead</strong> and <strong>Marked for Death</strong>. <br /><br />When you use your Channel Darkness, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Darkness again. Some Channel Darkness effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your necromancer spell save DC. <br /><br />Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Darkness twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Channel_Darkness:_Bind_Undead\" class=\"mw-headline\">Channel Darkness: Bind Undead</span></h3>\n<p>As an action, you present your unholy focus and speak a command that binds undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet and has a CR equal to or lower than your proficiency bonus must make a Willpower saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is charmed by you for 10 minutes and will follow your spoken commands to the best of its abilities.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Channel_Darkness:_Marked_for_Death\" class=\"mw-headline\">Channel Darkness: Marked for Death</span></h3>\n<p>As an action, you present your unholy symbol and speak a damning word at a humanoid of your choosing within 30 feet of you that can see or hear you. The target must make a Willpower saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, its AC is reduced by a number equal to half your proficiency bonus (rounded down), and the creature takes 1d4 necrotic damage at the start of each of its turns for the next minute. When you reach 6th level, the damage increases to 2d4, and it increases again at 18th level to 3d4.</p>\n<p>Only one creature can be marked for death in this manner at a time. Using this feature again ends the previous mark. A creature can repeat this save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect upon a success.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Quiet_Casting\" class=\"mw-headline\">Quiet Casting</span></h2>\n<p><em>6th-level Voidkeeper feature</em><br /><br />You learn to infuse silence into your spellcasting. When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 Soul Point to cast it without a verbal component.</p>\n<p>When you cast a spell that deals damage in this manner, and target a single creature that is unaware or surprised, instead of rolling for damage, you deal the maximum amount of the dice.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Cloak_of_the_Void\" class=\"mw-headline\">Cloak of the Void</span></h2>\n<p><em>14th-level Voidkeeper feature</em><br /><br />When you are reduced to 0 hit points, but not killed outright, you can use your reaction to be cloaked in the dark energies of the Void, dropping to 1 hit point instead. You then gain immunity to all damage until the start of your next turn.</p>\n<p>Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Dark_Guardian\" class=\"mw-headline\">Dark Guardian</span></h2>\n<p><em>18th-level Voidkeeper feature</em><br /><br />Whenever a living creature hits you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to expend a Soul Point to summon a skeletal dark guardian to interpose on your behalf. The dark guardian's AC is 12 + your Proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier. If the attack roll would still hit, the damage dealt to you is reduced by half. If the attack roll is lower than the dark guardian’s AC, the attack deals no damage and the dark guardian can immediately make a melee attack against that creature. The dark guardian’s attack roll bonus is equal to your spell attack modifier and deals bludgeoning damage equal to 3d6 + your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<p>Regardless if the initial attack hits or misses, the dark guardian then disappears.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Enemies of Elsweyr pg 10","levels":2,"subclass":"Voidkeeper","hitDice":"d8","hitDiceUsed":0,"saves":[],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","dec","his","itm","med","nat","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"int"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"7p78eooyEyF8LXNq":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.poHWQdLb44Dq42w8"},"cf":{"id":"temp_2hzqnpg3c6h","color":"#000000"}}}
