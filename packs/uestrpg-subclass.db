They are skilled in surviving far from the streets of a city, allowing them to scout ahead of their companions during expeditions. By contrast with barbarians, in combat scouts tend to be cautious and methodical, rather than impulsive. Many Scouts serve as the eyes and ears of war bands. Ambusher, spy, bounty hunter—these are just a few of the roles that Scouts assume as they range the world.</p>\n<table class=\"uestrpgtable\"><caption>Scout Features</caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Level</th>\n<th>Feature</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3rd</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Scout#Bonus_Proficiencies\">Bonus Proficiencies</a>, <a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Scout#Scout.E2.80.99s_Evasion\">Scout’s Evasion</a>, <a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Scout#Swiftness\">Swiftness</a>, <a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Scout#Scout.E2.80.99s_Techniques\">Scout’s Techniques</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7th</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Scout#Ambuscade\">Ambuscade</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11th</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Scout#Multiattack\">Multiattack</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15th</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Scout#Opportunistic_Striker\">Opportunistic Striker</a></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2><span id=\"Bonus_Proficiencies\" class=\"mw-headline\">Bonus Proficiencies</span></h2>\n<p><em>3rd-level Scout feature</em></p>\n<p>You gain proficiency in two of the following skills of your choice: Acrobatics, Animal Handling, Athletics, Investigation, Medicine, Nature, Perception, Stealth or Survival.

Each subsequent attack that hits the target after the first increases your critical score range by one. At the end of your turn, this feature ends and reverts your critical hit range back to normal.</p>\n<p>For example, hitting a target on your turn will allow the next attack on that same turn against that same target to score a critical hit on a roll of 19–20. Hitting the same target a second time will increase this critical hit range to 18–20, and so forth.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Basic Rules v1.4 pg 84","levels":3,"subclass":"Scout","hitDice":"d10","hitDiceUsed":0,"saves":["dex","con"],"skills":{"number":3,"choices":["ani","ath","ins","inv","nat","prc","ste","sur"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"none","ability":"wis"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"7p78eooyEyF8LXNq":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.0y3z0nNQqgFsjEgx"},"cf":{"id":"temp_x1njeoa5qeh","path":"Classes#/CF_SEP/Subclasses#/CF_SEP/Ranger","color":"#000000"}}}

On a failed save, each creature takes 2d8 necrotic damage for each Soul Point expended and they are infected with the same disease the creature was infected with. If the target is a corpse, you can choose to spread a disease that you know.

However, your GM might pick one of these animals for you, or an animal based on a creature appropriate for the campaign setting. You can find the statistics for these creatures in the <a title=\"BC:Blessings &amp; Curses\" href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BC:Blessings_%26_Curses\"> <em>Blessings and Curses</em></a> and the <a title=\"SoS:Shadows Over Skyrim\" href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/SoS:Shadows_Over_Skyrim\"><em>Shadows Over Skyrim</em></a> supplements, or in the <a class=\"extiw\" title=\"dndbeyond:sources/mm\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/mm\"><em>5e Core Rules</em></a>.</p>\n<p>You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.</p>\n<p>While you are transformed, the following rules apply:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the shapechanger, but you retain your alignment, proficiency bonus, Personality, Intelligence, and Willpower scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can't use them.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>When you transform, you assume the shapechanger’s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in shapechanger form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>You can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your shapechanger form. Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a spell you’ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can’t use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the GM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.</li>\n</ul>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Basic Rules v1.4 pg 82","levels":3,"subclass":"Hunter","hitDice":"d10","hitDiceUsed":0,"saves":["dex","con"],"skills":{"number":3,"choices":["ani","ath","ins","inv","nat","prc","ste","sur"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"none","ability":"wis"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"7p78eooyEyF8LXNq":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.0y3z0nNQqgFsjEgx"},"cf":{"id":"temp_x1njeoa5qeh","path":"Classes#/CF_SEP/Subclasses#/CF_SEP/Ranger","color":"#000000"}}}

As an action, you magically transform into an atronach that is associated with your element. This magical transformation lasts for 1 hour, and can be ended early as a bonus action. While in this new form, you assume the stats of the atronach of your elemental attunement. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest. (Refer to the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Basic Rules\" href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/Basic_Rules\"><em>Basic Rules</em></a> appendix A and the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Enemies of Elsweyr\" href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/Enemies_of_Elsweyr\"><em>Enemies of Elsweyr</em></a> chapter 3 for atronach stats.) <br /><br />While you are transformed, the following rules apply:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The new form can be any atronach whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the challenge rating listed in your elemental attunement below. Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the atronach, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Willpower, and Personality scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can't use them.</li>\n<li>When you transform, you assume the atronach's hit points and hit dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in your atronach form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren't knocked unconscious.</li>\n<li>You can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your atronach form. Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as call lightning, that you've already cast.</li>\n<li>You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can't use any of your special senses, such as Darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.</li>\n<li>You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br /><em><strong>Earth.</strong></em> You transform into either an iron, earth, or stone atronach with a CR of 5 or lower. At 18th level, you can transform into either an iron, earth, or stone atronach with a CR of 7 or lower. <br /><br /><em><strong>Flame.</strong></em> You transform into either a cold-flame or flame atronach with a CR of 5 or lower.

Crier</a> is a spiritual journey, as the barbarian learns to channel their life essence through their voice and breath. War Criers are rare in barbarian tribes, but those who have the gift are usually put into positions of power, either as shaman, spiritual leaders, or chieftains.</p>\n<p>Most <a title=\"Nord\" href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/Nord\">Nords</a> have some innate capacity for the power of the <a class=\"extiw\" title=\"uesp:Lore:Thu'um\" href=\"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Thu%27um\">Voice</a>, believing that their breath holds their vital essence. The other races can learn how to wield such power, but may require greater study, perhaps spending time with powerful Tongues.</p>\n<p><strong>Path of the War Crier Features</strong></p>\n<table class=\"uestrpgtable\"><caption> </caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Level</th>\n<th>Feature</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3rd</td>\n<td>Battle Thu'um, Draconic Tongue, Dragon Shouts (2)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6th</td>\n<td>Shout Resistance, Wrathful Shouts, Dragon Shouts (4)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10th</td>\n<td>Destructive Shouts, Draconic Rage, Dragon Shouts (6)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14th</td>\n<td>Thu'um Master, Dragon Shouts (8)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2><span id=\"Battle_Thu.27um\" class=\"mw-headline\">Battle Thu'um</span></h2>\n<p><em>3rd-level Path of the War Crier feature</em><br />You learn how to harness the power of the dragon tongue to form powerful shouts. A shout requires you to spend shout points each time you use one.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Shouts.</strong></em> You know the <em>Unrelenting Force</em> shout and two other shouts of your choice, which are detailed in the <strong>“Dragon Shouts”</strong> section at the end of the subclass description. You learn two additional shouts of your choice at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</p>\n<p>Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the dragon shouts you know and replace it with another dragon shout that you could learn at that level.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Shout Points.</strong></em> You have 2 shout points and you regain any expended shout points when you finish a short or long rest. Additionally, you regain 1 shout point when you enter your rage.</p>\n<p>You gain two additional shout points at 6th level (4), and again at 10th level (6), and 14th level (8).</p>\n<p><em><strong>Using Words of Power.</strong></em> The Thu’um is a form of magic that uses words of power from the draconic language to form powerful shouts. While the effects of a dragon shout are considered spells, they break some of the rules of spellcasting:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can use shouts even while raging.</li>\n<li>You require the ability to speak to be able to use a dragon shout.</li>\n<li>You do not require to use somatic or material components to cast spells as a dragon shout.</li>\n<li>Dragon shouts that create spells or effects that have a duration longer than instantaneous do not require concentration to maintain. You can only have one effect active at a time and any effects immediately end if you are incapacitated or cast another shout with a duration longer than instantaneous.</li>\n<li>You can only use one shout on each turn.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some dragon shouts require the target to make a saving throw to resist its effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>\n<p><strong>Dragon Shout save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Endurance modifier</p>\n<p>Once you reach 6th level in this class, you can spend additional shout points to increase the power of a shout that you cast, provided that it has an enhanced effect, as Unrelenting Force does.</p>\n<p>The maximum number of shout points you can spend to cast a shout in this way (including its base shout point cost and any additional shout points you spend to increase its effect) is determined by your barbarian level, as shown in the Maximum Shout Points table below.</p>\n<p><strong>Maximum Shout Points</strong></p>\n<table class=\"uestrpgtable\"><caption> </caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Barbarian Level</th>\n<th>Max. Shout Points for a Shout</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6th-8th</td>\n<td>3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9th-12th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13th-16th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17th-20th</td>\n<td>6</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2><span id=\"Draconic_Tongue\" class=\"mw-headline\">Draconic Tongue</span></h2>\n<p><em>3rd-level Path of the War Crier feature</em><br />You gain mastery with draconic words. You are now proficient in the <a class=\"extiw\" title=\"uesp:Lore:Dragon Language\" href=\"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Dragon_Language\">Dovahzul</a> language.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Shout_Resistance\" class=\"mw-headline\">Shout Resistance</span></h2>\n<p><em>6th-level Path of the War Crier feature</em><br />Your knowledge of the Thu’um has made you resistant to it. You have advantage on all saving throws made against shouts.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Wrathful_Shouts\" class=\"mw-headline\">Wrathful Shouts</span></h2>\n<p><em>6th-level Path of the War Crier feature</em><br />When you deal damage with a shout while raging, you add the damage bonus of your rage to one of the damage rolls.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Destructive_Shouts\" class=\"mw-headline\">Destructive Shouts</span></h2>\n<p><em>10th-level Path of the War Crier feature</em><br />You can focus on your shouts, making them deadlier by lowering your guard. Once on your turn when you cast a shout that requires a saving throw you can give one target disadvantage against the shout’s saving throw, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Draconic_Rage\" class=\"mw-headline\">Draconic Rage</span></h2>\n<p><em>10th-level Path of the War Crier feature</em><br />When you use a bonus action to enter into a rage, you can cast a dragon shout as part of the bonus action.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Thu’um_Master\"></span><span id=\"Thu.E2.80.99um_Master\" class=\"mw-headline\">Thu’um Master</span></h2>\n<p><em>14th-level Path of the War Crier feature</em><br />When you use your action to cast a dragon shout, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action. Additionally, when you enter your rage you recover 2 shout points, instead of 1.</p>\n<h1><span id=\"Dragon_Shouts\" class=\"mw-headline\">Dragon Shouts</span></h1>\n<p>The dragon shouts are presented in alphabetical order. If a shout has prerequisites, you must meet them to learn it. You can learn the shout at the same time that you meet its prerequisites.

This indifference ends if the target is attacked or harmed by a spell or if it witnesses any of its allies being harmed. The creature becomes hostile again after 1 minute, unless the DM rules otherwise. The duration increases by 1 minute for each additional shout point you spend.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Marked_for_Death_(Krii_Lun_Aus)\"></span><span id=\"Marked_for_Death_.28Krii_Lun_Aus.29\" class=\"mw-headline\">Marked for Death (Krii Lun Aus)</span></h3>\n<p>As a bonus action, you can spend 1 shout point to mark a creature as though you cast the <a class=\"extiw\" title=\"dndbeyond:spells/hunters-mark\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/hunters-mark\"><em>hunter’s mark</em></a> spell at 1st level.

However, if the plate is broken, and the person is struck with one of the shards, the person may be grievously wounded.

A blow that is concentrated into a small point becomes more potent. A highly trained fighter can be more deadly with just the thumb than to strike with the whole fist.</p>\n<p>The second aspect of concentration notes that with enough mental discipline, distraction can be ignored as the will maintains the ultimate goal.

With 8 hours of work and the expenditure of 200 septims worth of rare herbs and fine food, you call forth an animal from the wilderness to serve as your faithful companion from any beast with a CR of ½ or lower, such as an ape, a black bear, a boar, a giant badger, a giant weasel, a mule, a panther, or a wolf. However, your DM might pick one of these animals for you, based on the surrounding terrain and on what types of creatures would be logically present in the area. <br /><br />At the end of 8 hours, your animal companion appears and gains all the benefits of your Companion's Bond ability. You can have only one animal companion at a time. <br /><br />If your animal companion is ever slain, the magical bond you share allows you to return it to life. With 8 hours of work and the expenditure of 100 septims worth of rare herbs and fine food you call forth your companion's spirit and use your magic to create a new body for it. You can return an animal companion to life in this manner even if you do not possess any part of its body. <br /><br />If you use this ability to return a former animal companion to life while you have a current animal companion, your current companion leaves you and is replaced by the restored companion. <br /><br />If you gain a new animal companion at higher levels, you can choose from any beast with a CR as shown on the Beast Companions At Higher Levels table.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Companion's_Bond\"></span><span id=\"Companion.27s_Bond\" class=\"mw-headline\">Companion's Bond</span></h3>\n<p>Your animal companion gains a variety of benefits while it is linked to you. <br /><br />The animal companion loses it's Multiattack action, if it has one. <br /><br />The companion obeys your commands as best it can. It rolls for initiative like any other creature, but you determine its actions, decisions, attitudes, and so on. If you are incapacitated or absent, your companion acts on its own. <br /><br />Your animal companion has abilities and game statistics determined in part by your level. Your companion uses your proficiency bonus rather than its own. In addition to areas where it normally uses its proficiency bonus to its AC and to its damage rolls. <br /><br />Your animal companions gain proficiency in two skills of your choice. It also becomes proficient with all saving throws. <br /><br />For each level you gain after 2nd, your animal companion gains an additional hit die and increases its hit points accordingly. <br /><br />Whenever you gain the Attribute Score Improvement class feature, your companion's attributes also improve. Your companion can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or it can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, your companion can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature unless its description specifies otherwise. <br /><br />Your companion shares your alignment, and has a personality trait and a flaw that you can roll for or select from the tables below.

It counts as neither a creature or a an object, though it has the spectral appearance of a creature it represents. <br /><br />Your spirit companion acts independently of you, but it always obeys your commands. In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. A spirit companion can't attack, but it can take other actions as normal. <br /><br />While the spirit is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. Additionally, as an action, you can see through the spirit's eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses that the spirit has. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses. <br /><br />The spirit persists for 1 minute or until you're incapacitated. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest. <br /><br />The effects of the spirit companion depends on the type of spirit you summon from the options below. <br /><br /><em><strong>Falcon.</strong></em> You summon the spirit of a falcon. While you are within 60 feet of the spirit, you and your beast companion's speed increases by 10 feet. Additionally, when you see through the falcon spirit's eyes, you gaining advantage on Willpower (Perception) checks that rely on sight.<br /><br /><em><strong>Mastiff.</strong></em> You summon the spirit of a mastiff. While you are within 30 feet of the spirit, you and your beast companion gain advantage on Willpower (Perception) checks that rely on smell. <br /><br /><em><strong>Mountain Lion.</strong></em> You summon the spirit of a mountain lion. While you are within 30 feet of the spirit, you and your beast companion ignore difficult terrain, and when you or your beast companion make a running long jump, the distance you can cover increases by a number of feet equal to your Willpower modifier. <br /><br /><em><strong>Mouse.</strong></em> You summon the spirit of a mouse.

You are immune to being charmed, and when another creature attempts to charm you, you can use your reaction to attempt to turn the charm back on that creature. The creature must succeed on a Willpower saving throw against your nightblade spell save DC or be charmed by you for 1 minute or until the creature takes any damage.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Mind_Taking\" class=\"mw-headline\">Mind Taking</span></h2>\n<p>At 14th level, you gain the ability to make a creature unaware of your magical influence on it. When you cast a spell or use an ability to charm one or more creatures, you can alter one creature's understanding so that it remains unaware that it is being charmed.</p>\n<p>Additionally, once before the spell or effect expires, you can use your action to try to modify the chosen creature's memory of some of the time it spent while charmed. The creature must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw against your nightblade spell save DC. On a failed save, you can modify a number of hours of its memories equal to 1 + your Personality modifier (minimum 1). You can choose to modify less time if desired, and the amount of time can't exceed the duration of your illusion spell.</p>\n<p>A modified memory doesn’t necessarily affect how a creature behaves, particularly if the memory contradicts the creature’s natural inclinations, alignment, or beliefs. An illogical modified memory, such as implanting a memory of how much the creature enjoyed dousing itself in acid, is dismissed, perhaps as a bad dream. The DM might deem a modified memory too nonsensical to affect a creature in a significant manner.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Basic Rules v1.4 pg 73","levels":1,"subclass":"Trickster","hitDice":"d8","hitDiceUsed":0,"saves":["dex","int"],"skills":{"number":3,"choices":["acr","arc","ath","dec","his","ins","inv","prc","slt","ste"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"pact","ability":"cha"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"7p78eooyEyF8LXNq":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.iMO7NRNcLzk3RjEi"},"cf":{"id":"temp_6fqw4rv4gge","path":"Classes#/CF_SEP/Subclasses#/CF_SEP/Nightblade","color":"#000000"}}}

The more powerful a spinner becomes, the more powerful their prescience seems to be. <br /><br />It is rare for a spinner to take up a life of adventuring, but those that do seek to protect and preserve Y'ffre's gifts, collect stories of their adventuring to be recorded for future historians.</p>\n<table class=\"uestrpgtable\"><caption>Conclave of Spinners Features</caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Level</th>\n<th>Feature</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2nd</td>\n<td>Bonus Proficiencies, Mark of Foresight, Spinner Spells</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6th</td>\n<td>Spinner's Prediction</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10th</td>\n<td>Serenity</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14th</td>\n<td>Spinner's Revelations</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2><span id=\"Bonus_Proficiencies\" class=\"mw-headline\">Bonus Proficiencies</span></h2>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>When you choose this conclave at 2nd level, you gain proficiency with the Performance skill and you learn one <a class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Bard\" href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/Bard\">bard</a> cantrip of your choice.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Mark_of_Foresight\" class=\"mw-headline\">Mark of Foresight</span></h2>\n<p>When you choose this conclave at 2nd level, you gain the ability to predict the actions of your marked target. <br /><br /><em><strong>Ally.</strong></em> When a creature marked as an Ally by your Mark of Balance makes an ability check or a saving throw, they can add your proficiency bonus to the roll. <br /><br /><em><strong>Enemy.</strong></em> When you mark a creature as an Enemy with your Mark of Balance, the creature must make a Personality saving throw, with a DC equal to your Spell Save DC, or be charmed by you.

These philosophical monks, known as the <a class=\"extiw\" title=\"uesp:Lore:Greybeards\" href=\"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Greybeards\">Greybeards</a>, spend most of their time in silent meditation, isolated atop Skyrim's largest mountain, the <a class=\"extiw\" title=\"uesp:Lore:Throat of the World\" href=\"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Throat_of_the_World\">Throat of the World</a>.</p>\n<p>The Greybeards believe in using the <a class=\"extiw\" title=\"uesp:Lore:Way of the Voice\" href=\"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Way_of_the_Voice\">Voice</a> to attain enlightenment, rather than as a tool of war. This doesn't mean that they teach pacifism, only that the Voice can be used more more than just simple violence. They believe that those who can wield the Voice should only do so in times of true need.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Way of the Voice Features</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<table class=\"uestrpgtable\"><caption> </caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Level</th>\n<th>Feature</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3rd</td>\n<td>Discipline of the Voice, Minor Thu'um, Dragon Shouts (2)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6th</td>\n<td>Passage of Knowledge, Dragon Shouts (4)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11th</td>\n<td>Speed of 7,000 Steps, Dragon Shouts (6)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17th</td>\n<td>Might of the Tongues, Dragon Shouts (8)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2><span id=\"Discipline_of_the_Voice\" class=\"mw-headline\">Discipline of the Voice</span></h2>\n<p><em>3rd-level Way of the Voice feature</em><br />You learn how to harness the power of the dragon tongue to form powerful shouts. A shout requires you to spend stamina points each time you use one. When you use a shout that requires you to expend 2 stamina points or less, you can choose not to expend any stamina points a number of times equal to half your proficiency bonus (rounded up). Once you use a shout in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Shouts.</strong></em> You know the <em>Unrelenting Force</em> shout and two other shouts of your choice, which are detailed in the <strong>“Dragon Shouts”</strong> section at the end of the subclass description. You learn two additional shouts of your choice at 6th, 11th, and 17th level. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the dragon shouts you know and replace it with another dragon shout that you could learn at that level.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Using Words of Power.</strong></em> The Thu'um is a form of magic which uses words from the <a class=\"extiw\" title=\"uesp:Lore:Dragon Language\" href=\"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Dragon_Language\">draconic</a> language to form powerful shouts. While the effects of a dragon shout are considered spells, they break some of the rules of spellcasting:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You require the ability to speak to be able to use a dragon shout.</li>\n<li>You do not require to use somatic or material components to cast spells as a dragon shout.</li>\n<li>Dragon shouts that create spells or effects that have a duration longer than instantaneous do not require concentration to maintain. You can only have one effect active at a time and any effects immediately end if you are incapacitated or cast another shout with a duration longer than instantaneous.</li>\n<li>You can only use one shout on each turn.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You use your Stamina save DC for any shouts or spells that require a saving throw to resist its effects. Once you reach 5th level in this class, you can spend additional stamina points to increase the power of a shout that you cast, provided that it has an enhanced effect, as Unrelenting Force does. The maximum number of stamina points you can spend to cast a shout in this way (including its base stamina point cost and any additional stamina points you spend to increase its effect) is determined by your monk level, as shown in the Maximum Shout Points table below.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Maximum Shout Points</p>\n<p> </p>\n<table class=\"uestrpgtable\"><caption> </caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Monk Level</th>\n<th>Max.

You gain a new attack option that you can use with the Attack action. This special attack is a ranged spell attack with a range of 30 feet. You are proficient with it, and you add your Willpower modifier to its attack and damage rolls. Its damage is force, and its damage die is a d4. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table. This special attack is considered a monk weapon for you. When you gain the Extra Attack feature, this special attack can be used for any of the attacks you make as part of the Attack action.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Passage_of_Knowledge\" class=\"mw-headline\">Passage of Knowledge</span></h2>\n<p><em>6th-level Way of the Voice feature</em><br />Your understanding of the voice allows you to temporarily teach it to others. As an action, you whisper one of the dragon shouts you know to a creature within 5 feet of you that can speak and knows at least one language, filling its mind with the words of power. That creature can use this shout using your Stamina save DC once before it finishes a long rest. You expend stamina points for the shout as normal. You cannot spend more than 3 stamina points to use this feature. Once the shout is used, the knowledge of it vanishes from the creature’s mind. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Speed_of_the_7,000_Steps\"></span><span id=\"Speed_of_the_7.2C000_Steps\" class=\"mw-headline\">Speed of the 7,000 Steps</span></h2>\n<p><em>11th-level Way of the Voice feature</em><br />Your understanding of the Thu’um allows you to combine it with your martial arts. When you use a Dragon Shout, you can make an unarmed strike or use Flurry of Blows, as if you had used a monk weapon or an unarmed strike. In addition, you may use your Minor Thu’um feature as a bonus action after attacking with a monk weapon or an unarmed strike.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Might_of_the_Tongues\" class=\"mw-headline\">Might of the Tongues</span></h2>\n<p><em>17th-level Way of the Voice feature</em><br />You can tap deep into your knowledge of the voice to destroy your enemies in times of true need. When you use a Dragon Shout without expending any stamina points, treat the shout as if you had spent 3 stamina points.</p>\n<h1><span id=\"Dragon_Shouts\" class=\"mw-headline\">Dragon Shouts</span></h1>\n<p>The dragon shouts are presented in alphabetical order. If a shout has prerequisites, you must meet them to learn it. You can learn the shout at the same time that you meet its prerequisites. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Animal_Allegiance_(Raan_Mir_Tah)\"></span><span id=\"Animal_Allegiance_.28Raan_Mir_Tah.29\" class=\"mw-headline\">Animal Allegiance (Raan Mir Tah)</span></h3>\n<p><em>Prerequisite: 6th level</em><br />As an action, You can spend 2 shout points to summon beasts of the wild.

The number of creatures that appear is twice as many if you spend 2 additional shout points, three times as many with 3 additional shout points, and four times as many with 4 additional shout points.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Aura_Whisper_(Laas_Yah_Nir)\"></span><span id=\"Aura_Whisper_.28Laas_Yah_Nir.29\" class=\"mw-headline\">Aura Whisper (Laas Yah Nir)</span></h3>\n<p>As an action, you can spend 1 shout point to whisper a short phrase, revealing all life forces to yourself, as though you had cast the <a title=\"New Spells\" href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/New_Spells\"><em>detect life</em></a> spell. The range increases by 10 feet for each additional shout point you spend.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Battle_Fury_(Mid_Vur_Shaan)\"></span><span id=\"Battle_Fury_.28Mid_Vur_Shaan.29\" class=\"mw-headline\">Battle Fury (Mid Vur Shaan)</span></h3>\n<p><em>Prerequisite: 6th level</em><br />As a bonus action, you can spend 1 shout point to enchant your allies’ weapons, allowing them to make a quick attack. One creature of your choice that is within 30 feet of you can immediately use their reaction to make a weapon attack.</p>\n<p>One additional creature within 30 feet of you can use their reaction to make a weapon attack for each additional shout point you spend.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Become_Ethereal_(Feim_Zii_Gron)\"></span><span id=\"Become_Ethereal_.28Feim_Zii_Gron.29\" class=\"mw-headline\">Become Ethereal (Feim Zii Gron)</span></h3>\n<p><em>Prerequisite: 11th level</em><br />As an action, you can spend 3 stamina points to speak to the void, changing your form.

The spirit appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within 60 feet of you. The spirit is considered to be a Celestial and it disappears after 1 minute, when it drops to 0 hit points, or if you become unconscious.</p>\n<p>The summoned spirit is friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the spirit, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue it (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any commands to the spirit, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions. See this creature’s game statistics in the Valiant Warrior stat block (Enemies of Elsweyr), but you add your level to its hit points and half your proficiency bonus to its attack roll and damage roll.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Clear_Skies_(Lok_Vah_Koor)\"></span><span id=\"Clear_Skies_.28Lok_Vah_Koor.29\" class=\"mw-headline\">Clear Skies (Lok Vah Koor)</span></h3>\n<p>As an action, you can spend 1 shout point to use your voice to dispel any natural or magical inclement weather that you can see within 1 mile, forcing only clear skies to remain.

A creature must repeat this save when it comes within 5 feet of the cyclone for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.</p>\n<p>As a bonus action, you can move the cyclone up to 30 feet in any direction. The cyclone heavily obscures its area and sucks up any small materials, such as loose rocks, sand, or coins, within a 10-foot radius of it.

One creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature drops one object of your choice it is holding in its hands and the object lands at a point of your choosing within 15 feet of the target. On a successful save, the creature continues to hold on to the objects in their hands, but they have disadvantage on any rolls made using the object, such as weapon attacks, until the end of their next turn.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Dismay_(Faas_Ru_Maar)\"></span><span id=\"Dismay_.28Faas_Ru_Maar.29\" class=\"mw-headline\">Dismay (Faas Ru Maar)</span></h3>\n<p><em>Prerequisite: 10th level</em><br />As an action, you can spend 2 shout points to speak a force of terror.

Choose either fire, cold or lightning. Each creature in a 15-foot cone must make an Agility saving throw. A creature takes 4d8 elemental damage on a failed save, and half as much on a successful one. The shouts are: Fire Breath (Yol Toor Shul), Frost Breath (Fo Krah Diin) and Storm Breath (Sov Ag Slen). The damage increases by 1d8 and the size of its cone increases by 15 feet for each additional shout point you spend.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Elemental_Fury_(Su_Grah_Dun)\"></span><span id=\"Elemental_Fury_.28Su_Grah_Dun.29\" class=\"mw-headline\">Elemental Fury (Su Grah Dun)</span></h3>\n<p><em>Prerequisite: 11th level</em><br />As a bonus action, you spend 3 stamina points to imbue yourself with the speed of the wind. You cast the <a class=\"extiw\" title=\"dndbeyond:spells/haste\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/haste\"><em>haste</em></a> spell on yourself, but after the spell ends you do not experience a wave of lethargy.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Ice_Form_(Iiz_Slen_Nus)\"></span><span id=\"Ice_Form_.28Iiz_Slen_Nus.29\" class=\"mw-headline\">Ice Form (Iiz Slen Nus)</span></h3>\n<p><em>Prerequisite: 14th level</em><br />As an action, you can spend 4 shout points to freeze a creature. One creature of your choice that you can see within 90 feet of you must succeed on an Endurance saving throw or take 4d8 cold damage and be encased in a shell of ice. The encased creature is immobilized and can't speak, hear, move, or take any actions. The creature takes this damage again at the start of its turn while encased. The creature restrained by this spell must make another Endurance saving throw at the end of each of their turns to try and break free. If it successfully saves against this effect three times, the effect ends. If it fails its save three times, the frost hardens and the creature is subjected to the frozen condition. The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind.</p>\n<p>While the effect is active, the frost shell has an AC of 10 and has 30 hit points. When the frost shell reaches 0 hit points, the shell breaks, ending the effect. A <a class=\"extiw\" title=\"dndbeyond:spells/dispel-magic\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dispel-magic\"><em>dispel magic</em></a> spell can also end the effects. The damage increases by 1d8 for each additional shout point you spend.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Kyne’s_Peace_(Kaan_Drem_Ov)\"></span><span id=\"Kyne.E2.80.99s_Peace_.28Kaan_Drem_Ov.29\" class=\"mw-headline\">Kyne’s Peace (Kaan Drem Ov)</span></h3>\n<p>As an action, you can spend 1 shout point to speak to a group of animals to soothe them. Each Beast that is within 60 feet of you and can hear you must make a Personality saving throw; a creature can choose to fail this saving throw if it wishes. If the creature fails the saving throw, any effect causing the target to be charmed or frightened ends, and the target becomes indifferent about any creatures of your choice that it is hostile toward. This indifference ends if the target is attacked or harmed by a spell or if it witnesses any of its allies being harmed. The creature becomes hostile again after 1 minute, unless the DM rules otherwise. The duration increases by 1 minute for each additional shout point you spend.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Marked_for_Death_(Krii_Lun_Aus)\"></span><span id=\"Marked_for_Death_.28Krii_Lun_Aus.29\" class=\"mw-headline\">Marked for Death (Krii Lun Aus)</span></h3>\n<p>As a bonus action, you can spend 1 shout point to mark a creature as though you cast the <a class=\"extiw\" title=\"dndbeyond:spells/hunters-mark\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/hunters-mark\"><em>hunter’s mark</em></a> spell at 1st level.

You learn one additional assassin's poison of your choice at 9th level, and again at 13th, and 17th level.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Poisons.</strong></em> Once each day, when you spend 1 hour gathering materials and creating poison, you create a series of vials with the various assassin's poisons you know. You can use any combination of these poisons an amount of times equal to your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<p>On your turn, you can use a bonus action to apply the poison to a weapon, a piece of ammunition, trap components, or other objects that deal piercing or slashing damage.

The potency of all unused poisons is lost after 24 hours.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Saving Throws.</strong></em> Your poisons require your target to make an Endurance saving throw to resist the poisons effects. On a failed save, the target is effected by the poison as noted in its description. On a successful save, the target takes half the amount of damage and suffers no other effects. An affected creature can make another saving throw at the start of each of their turns.

In addition, any hit you score against a creature that is surprised is a critical hit.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Death_Strike\" class=\"mw-headline\">Death Strike</span></h2>\n<p>Starting at 17th level, you become a master of instant death. The first time on your turn when you attack and hit a creature that is surprised, it must make an Endurance saving throw (DC 8 + your Agility modifier + your proficiency bonus).

If the original attack roll would hit any additional creatures, they take damage equal to the number you roll on your tactical die, divided equally between the additional creatures hit. The main target only takes the damage from your original attack.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Commander's Strike.</strong></em> When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can forgo one of your attacks and use a bonus action to direct one of your companions to strike. When you do so, choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you and expend one tactical die. That creature can immediately use its reaction to make one weapon attack, adding a tactical die to the attack's damage roll.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Feinting Attack.</strong></em> You can expend one tactical die and use a bonus action on your turn to feint, choosing one creature within 5 feet of you as your target. You have advantage on your next attack roll against that creature this turn. If that attack hits, add the tactical die to the attack's damage roll.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Lunging Attack.</strong></em> When you make a melee weapon attack on your turn, you can expend one tactical die to increase your reach for the attack by 5 feet. If you hit, you add the tactical die to the attack's damage roll.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Menacing Attack.</strong></em> When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one tactical die to attempt to frighten the target. You add your tactical die to the attacks damage roll, and the target must make a Personality saving throw. On a failed save, it is frightened of you until the end of your next turn.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Pierce Armor.</strong></em> When you hit a creature that is wearing armor with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one tactical die to weaken their armor, reducing the targets AC by 1. If you hit, you add the tactical die to the attack's damage roll. You can not weaken the same armor more than once.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Precision Attack.</strong></em> When you make a weapon attack roll against a creature, you can expend one tactical die to add a tactical die to the roll. You can use this tactic before or after making the attack roll, but before any effects of the attack are applied.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Riposte.</strong></em> When an enemy misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction and expend one tactical die to make a melee weapon attack against the same enemy. If you hit, add a tactical die to the attack's damage roll.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Sweeping Attack.</strong></em> When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one tactical die to attempt to damage another creature within 5 feet of the original target and within your reach. If the original attack roll would hit the second creature, it takes damage equal to the number you roll on your tactical die. The damage is of the same type dealt for the original attack.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Uppercut.</strong></em> When you hit a creature with weapon attack, you can expend one tactical die to attempt to slam the target with an upward blow, knocking the target down. You add the tactical die to the attack's damage roll, and if the target is Large or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it is knocked back 5 feet and falls prone.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Basic Rules v1.4 pg 117","levels":3,"subclass":"Assault","hitDice":"d10","hitDiceUsed":0,"saves":["str","con"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["acr","ani","ath","his","ins","itm","prc","sur"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"none","ability":"con"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"7p78eooyEyF8LXNq":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.ekJi5CDHX59W1IpP"},"cf":{"id":"temp_bacco8ly4j8","path":"Classes#/CF_SEP/Subclasses#/CF_SEP/Warrior","color":"#000000"}}}

The illusion appears in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you. The illusion looks exactly like you; it is silent; it is your size, is insubstantial, and doesn’t occupy its space; and it is unaffected by attacks and damage. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the illusion up to 30 feet to a space you can see, but the illusion must remain within 120 feet of you.</p>\n<p>For the duration, you can cast spells as though you were in the illusion’s space, but you must use your own senses. Additionally, when both you and your illusion are within 5 feet of a creature that can see the illusion, you have advantage on attack rolls against that creature, given how uncanny the illusion is.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Poison Strike.</strong></em> You can use your Channel Divinity to make a weapon deadlier. As a bonus action, you touch one weapon or piece of ammunition and conjure a special poison on it. The poison lasts for 1 minute. The next time you hit a target with an attack using that weapon or ammunition, the target takes poison damage immediately after the attack. The poison damage equals 2d10 + your crusader level, or 20 + your crusader level if you had advantage on the attack roll.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Aura_of_Treachery\" class=\"mw-headline\">Aura of Treachery</span></h2>\n<p>Starting at 7th level, you emanate an aura of discord, which gives you the following benefits.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Cull the Herd.</strong></em> You have advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature that has one or more of its allies within 5 feet of it.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Treacherous Strike.</strong></em> If a creature within 5 feet of you misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to force the attacker to reroll that attack against a creature of your choice that is also within 5 feet of the attacker. The ability fails and is wasted if the attacker is immune to being charmed. You can use this ability three times, and regain expended uses of it when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Divine_Smite:_Poison\" class=\"mw-headline\">Divine Smite: Poison</span></h2>\n<p>Also at 7th level, whenever you use the Divine Smite feature, you can choose to infuse your weapon strikes with poison damage instead of lightning.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Blackguard's_Escape\"></span><span id=\"Blackguard.27s_Escape\" class=\"mw-headline\">Blackguard's Escape</span></h2>\n<p>At 15th level, you have the ability to slip away from your foes. Immediately after you are hit by an attack, you can use your reaction to turn invisible and teleport up to 60 feet to a spot you can see. You remain invisible until the end of your next turn or until you attack, deal damage, or force a creature to make a saving throw.</p>\n<p>Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Icon_of_Deceit\" class=\"mw-headline\">Icon of Deceit</span></h2>\n<p>At 20th level, you gain the ability to emanate feelings of treachery.

A creature automatically succeeds on the save if the creature is immune to being charmed.</li>\n<li>If you have advantage on an attack roll, you gain a bonus to its damage roll equal to your crusader level.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Playtest","levels":3,"subclass":"Blackguard","hitDice":"d10","hitDiceUsed":0,"saves":["wis","cha"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["ath","ins","itm","med","per","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"half","ability":"wis"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"7p78eooyEyF8LXNq":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.XpwXthpCKjo0iJDW"},"cf":{"id":"temp_35sq72a0ng5","path":"Classes#/CF_SEP/Subclasses#/CF_SEP/Crusader","color":"#000000"}}}

If a totem requires a creature to make a saving throw, the DC is determined by your Spell Save DC. <br /><br /><em><strong>Agony Totem.</strong></em> Whenever a creature moves into a space within a 30-foot radius of the totem for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it takes 1d6 necrotic damage. <br /><br /><em><strong>Bone Totem.</strong></em> You and your allies gain a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws while within a 30-foot radius of the totem. <br /><br /><em><strong>Fear Totem.</strong></em> One creature of your choice within a 30-foot radius of the totem must succeed on a Willpower saving throw or become frightened of you or an ally of your choice. You can use a bonus action on a subsequent turn of yours to attempt to frighten another creature, ending the effect on a creature already frightened by the totem. A creature frightened by the totem can make a Willpower saving throw at the end of each of their turns, ending the effect on a success. <br /><br /><em><strong>Grasping Totem.</strong></em> Whenever a creature moves into a space within a 30-foot radius of the totem for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must succeed on an Agility saving throw or become restrained. The restrained creature can make this saving throw again on the start of each of its turns. <br /><br />The totem has 20 hit points and an AC of 12 and remains for 1 hour or until its hit points are reduced to 0 or a new totem is created.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Bone_Goliath\" class=\"mw-headline\">Bone Goliath</span></h2>\n<p>At 6th level, you gain the ability to temporarily turn yourself into a guardian of bone. As a bonus action, you transform into a bone goliath, which lasts for the next minute, you use a bonus action to end it, or until you are incapacitated. You undergo the following changes while you are in your bone goliath form:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your size becomes large, unless you were larger.</li>\n<li>Your reach increases by 5 feet.</li>\n<li>You gain a number of temporary hit points equal to twice your necromancer level. When your transformation ends, you lose any temporary hit points you have from it.</li>\n<li>You deal an extra die of damage when you make a melee weapon attack.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br />Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Disdain_Harm\" class=\"mw-headline\">Disdain Harm</span></h2>\n<p>At 14th level, you become more resilient to bodily devastation. You gain a damage threshold of 5, which grants you immunity to all damage unless you take an amount of damage from a single attack or effect equal to or greater than your damage threshold, in which case you take damage as normal. Any damage that fails to meet or exceed your damage threshold is considered superficial and doesn't reduce your hit points. <br />Your damage threshold increases to 8 when you reach 17th level, and increases to 10 when you reach 20th level. <br /><br />Additionally, when you take damage from an attack you can see, you can use your reaction and expend one or more Soul Points to reduce the damage taken by 1d8 for each Soul Point used.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Last_Gasp\" class=\"mw-headline\">Last Gasp</span></h2>\nAt 18th level, when you are reduced to 0 hit points, any Soul Points that you have are immediately expended and you regain 10 hit points for each soul point expended. If you do not have any Soul Points, you are reduced to 1 hit point instead. <br />Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</div>\n</div>\n</div>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Enemies of Elsweyr pg 17","levels":2,"subclass":"Undying Warrior","hitDice":"d8","hitDiceUsed":0,"saves":[],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","dec","his","itm","med","nat","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"int"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"7p78eooyEyF8LXNq":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.poHWQdLb44Dq42w8"},"cf":{"id":"temp_2yzu6binvby","path":"Classes#/CF_SEP/Subclasses#/CF_SEP/Necromancer","color":"#000000"}}}

You learn one exploit from the list of Master’s Exploits at the end of this subclass. These exploits allow you to enhance your fighting style. You can learn any master’s exploit, but you only gain the benefit from them if you also know the governing fighting style.</p>\n<p>You learn an additional exploit when you reach 7th level in this class (2), and again at 10th level (3), 15th level (4), and 18th level (5).

When you finish a long rest, you can spend part of that rest meditating on your training. At the end of the rest, you can replace a fighting style you know with another fighting style available to warriors. When you reach 18th level in this class, you have mastered adjusting your fighting style quickly. You can use an action to replace a fighting style you know with another fighting style available to warriors.</p>\n<p>Additionally, when you draw or stow a weapon as an action or object interaction, you can also draw or stow one additional weapon as a part of the same action.

Information includes general details on its background and personal life, but does not include secrets.

The target must make a Willpower saving throw against your spell save DC. It automatically succeeds if it doesn’t share a language with you or if it can’t hear you. On a successful saving throw, your whisper sounds like unintelligible mumbling and has no effect. If the target fails its saving throw, it is charmed by you for the next 8 hours or until you or your allies attack or damage it. It interprets the whispers as a description of its most mortifying secret. While you gain no knowledge of this secret, the target is convinced you know it.</p>\n<p>While charmed in this way, the creature obeys your commands for fear that you will reveal its secret. It won’t risk its life for you or fight for you, unless it was already inclined to do so. It grants you favors and gifts it would offer to a close friend.</p>\n<p>When the effect ends, the creature has no understanding of why it held you in such fear.

Races without the natural weapons of a Khajiit, including the elven appearing Ohmes, learn the Whispering Fang's superior combat methods with the use of awls, katars, and daggers.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Way of the Whispering Fang Features</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<table class=\"uestrpgtable\"><caption> </caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Level</th>\n<th>Feature</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3rd</td>\n<td>Monk Weaponry</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6th</td>\n<td>Wholeness of Body</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11th</td>\n<td>Cloak of Shadows</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17th</td>\n<td>Opportunist</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2><span id=\"Monk_Weaponry\" class=\"mw-headline\">Monk Weaponry</span></h2>\n<p>Starting at 3rd level, when you use monk weapons, you can choose to deal damage equal to the weapon's description, or by an amount equal to 1 size of dice larger than the your current martial arts die listed in the Martial Arts column of the <a title=\"BR:Monk\" href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Monk\">Monk table</a>. For example, at 3rd level instead of 1d4, your hand-to-hand weapon attacks deal 1d6 damage.

You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die. <br /><br />While you are transformed, the following rules apply:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Willpower, and Personality scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus instead of yours. If the creature has an legendary or lair actions, you can't use them.</li>\n<li>When you transform, you assume the beast's hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren't knocked unconscious.</li>\n<li>You can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your breast form. Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as call lightning, that you've already cast.</li>\n<li>You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can't use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.</li>\n<li>You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it.

You can't choose the same Defensive Style twice.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Bulwark\" class=\"mw-headline\">Bulwark</span></h2>\n<p>Beginning at 15th level, you can extend the benefit of your Indomitable feature to an ally. When use your Indomitable feature to reroll a saving throw and you aren't incapacitated, you can choose one ally within 60 feet of you that also failed its saving throw against the same effect. If that creature can see or hear you, it can reroll its saving throw and must use the new roll.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Survivor\" class=\"mw-headline\">Survivor</span></h2>\n<p>At 18th level, you attain the pinnacle of resilience in battle. At the start of each of your turns, you regain hit points equal to 5 + your Endurance modifier if you have no more than half your hit points left. You don't gain this benefit if you have 0 hit points.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Defensive_Tactics_2\" class=\"mw-headline\">Defensive Tactics</span></h2>\n<p>The tactics are presented in alphabetical order.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Disarming Attack.</strong></em> When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one tactical die to attempt to disarm the target, forcing it to drop one item of your choice that it's holding. You add the tactical die to the attack's damage roll, and the target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it drops the object you choose. The object lands at its feet.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Evasive footwork.</strong></em> When you move, you can expend one tactical die, rolling a tactical die and adding the number rolled to your AC until you stop moving.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Goading Attack.</strong></em> When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one tactical die to attempt to goad the target into attacking you. You add the tactical die to the attack's damage roll, and the target must make a Willpower saving throw. On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on all attack rolls against targets other than you until the end of your next turn.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Maneuvering Attack.</strong></em> When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one tactical die to maneuver one of your comrades into a more advantageous position. You add the tactical die to the attack's damage roll, and you choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you. That creature can use it's reaction to move up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks from the target of your attack.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Parry.</strong></em> When another creature damages you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction and expend one tactical die to reduce the damage by the number you roll on your tactical die + your Agility modifier.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Power Bash.</strong></em> When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one tactical die to attempt to throw the attacker off balance. You add the tactical die roll to the attack's damage roll, and it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it is staggered and has disadvantage on their next attack.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Pushing Attack.</strong></em> When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one tactical die to attempt to drive the target back. You add the tactical die roll to the attack's damage roll, and if the target is Large or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it is pushed back 15 feet.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Rally.</strong></em> On your turn, you can use a bonus action and expend one tactical die to bolster the resolve of one of your companions. When you do so, choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you. That creature gains temporary hit points equal to the tactical die roll + your Personality modifier.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Shield Wall.</strong></em> When another creature attacks you, you can use your reaction and expend one tactical die to increase your AC by the number you roll on your tactical die, until the start of your next turn.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Trip Attack.</strong></em> When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one tactical die to attempt to knock the target down. You add the tactical die to the attack's damage roll, and if the target is Large or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you knock the target prone.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Basic Rules v1.4 pg 119","levels":3,"subclass":"Defense","hitDice":"d10","hitDiceUsed":0,"saves":["str","con"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["acr","ani","ath","his","ins","itm","prc","sur"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"none","ability":"con"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"7p78eooyEyF8LXNq":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.ekJi5CDHX59W1IpP"},"cf":{"id":"temp_bacco8ly4j8","path":"Classes#/CF_SEP/Subclasses#/CF_SEP/Warrior","color":"#000000"}}}

Centuries ago, the Direnni mages and sorcerers formalized many of the rituals, chants, and incantations that are still used today.</p>\n<p>When a mage uses conjuration magic, they create a connection from their mind to the summoned entity. It is a tenuous link, meant to lure, hold, and dismiss, but in the hand of a master, it becomes much stronger.</p>\n<p>Detractors of conjuration believe that the pursuit of summoning and control is desperate and dangerous, however, conjurers understand the risks of their power. As a mage of the School of Conjuration, you have learned how to summon powerful elemental daedra to serve as guardians and protectors, and sometimes as servants and familiars. Unlike the unpredictable dremora, the nonbelligerent atronachs are much more reliable servants, as they are not aligned with any daedric prince.</p>\n<p><strong>School of Conjuration Features </strong></p>\n<table class=\"uestrpgtable\"><caption> </caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Level</th>\n<th>Feature</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2nd</td>\n<td>Conjuration Prodigy, Minor Conjuration, Atromancer</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6th</td>\n<td>Elemental Bond</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10th</td>\n<td>Focused Conjuration</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14th</td>\n<td>Elemental Soul</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2><span id=\"Conjuration_Prodigy\" class=\"mw-headline\">Conjuration Prodigy</span></h2>\n<p>Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to learn a conjuration spell is halved.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Minor_Conjuration\" class=\"mw-headline\">Minor Conjuration</span></h2>\n<p>Starting at 2nd level when you select this school, you can use your action to conjure up an inanimate object in your hand or on the ground in an unoccupied space that you can see within 10 feet of you. This object can be no larger than 3 feet on a side and weigh no more than 10 pounds, and its form must be that of a non-magical object that you have seen. The object is visibly magical, radiating dim light out to 5 feet.</p>\n<p>The object disappears after 1 hour, when you use this feature again, or if it takes any damage.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Atromancer\" class=\"mw-headline\">Atromancer</span></h2>\n<p>Starting at 2nd level, you learn the conjuration spell <a title=\"BR:Conjure Atronach\" href=\"https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Conjure_Atronach\"><em>conjure atronach</em></a>.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Elemental_Bond\" class=\"mw-headline\">Elemental Bond</span></h2>\n<p>At 6th level, you share a bond with your conjured atronach.

You also gain proficiency in the Stealth or Survival skill (your choice).</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Channel_Darkness\" class=\"mw-headline\">Channel Darkness</span></h2>\n<p><em>2nd-level Voidkeeper feature</em><br /><br />You gain the ability to channel dark energy directly from the Void, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You can use an unholy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your necromancer spells and your Channel Darkness effects. You start with two such effects: <strong>Bind Undead</strong> and <strong>Marked for Death</strong>. <br /><br />When you use your Channel Darkness, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Darkness again. Some Channel Darkness effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your necromancer spell save DC. <br /><br />Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Darkness twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Channel_Darkness:_Bind_Undead\" class=\"mw-headline\">Channel Darkness: Bind Undead</span></h3>\n<p>As an action, you present your unholy focus and speak a command that binds undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet and has a CR equal to or lower than your proficiency bonus must make a Willpower saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is charmed by you for 10 minutes and will follow your spoken commands to the best of its abilities.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Channel_Darkness:_Marked_for_Death\" class=\"mw-headline\">Channel Darkness: Marked for Death</span></h3>\n<p>As an action, you present your unholy symbol and speak a damning word at a humanoid of your choosing within 30 feet of you that can see or hear you. The target must make a Willpower saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, its AC is reduced by a number equal to half your proficiency bonus (rounded down), and the creature takes 1d4 necrotic damage at the start of each of its turns for the next minute. When you reach 6th level, the damage increases to 2d4, and it increases again at 18th level to 3d4.</p>\n<p>Only one creature can be marked for death in this manner at a time. Using this feature again ends the previous mark. A creature can repeat this save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect upon a success.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Quiet_Casting\" class=\"mw-headline\">Quiet Casting</span></h2>\n<p><em>6th-level Voidkeeper feature</em><br /><br />You learn to infuse silence into your spellcasting. When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 Soul Point to cast it without a verbal component.</p>\n<p>When you cast a spell that deals damage in this manner, and target a single creature that is unaware or surprised, instead of rolling for damage, you deal the maximum amount of the dice.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Cloak_of_the_Void\" class=\"mw-headline\">Cloak of the Void</span></h2>\n<p><em>14th-level Voidkeeper feature</em><br /><br />When you are reduced to 0 hit points, but not killed outright, you can use your reaction to be cloaked in the dark energies of the Void, dropping to 1 hit point instead. You then gain immunity to all damage until the start of your next turn.</p>\n<p>Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Dark_Guardian\" class=\"mw-headline\">Dark Guardian</span></h2>\n<p><em>18th-level Voidkeeper feature</em><br /><br />Whenever a living creature hits you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to expend a Soul Point to summon a skeletal dark guardian to interpose on your behalf. The dark guardian's AC is 12 + your Proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier. If the attack roll would still hit, the damage dealt to you is reduced by half. If the attack roll is lower than the dark guardian’s AC, the attack deals no damage and the dark guardian can immediately make a melee attack against that creature. The dark guardian’s attack roll bonus is equal to your spell attack modifier and deals bludgeoning damage equal to 3d6 + your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<p>Regardless if the initial attack hits or misses, the dark guardian then disappears.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Legionnaire's Guide to Cyrodiil pg. 33","levels":2,"subclass":"Voidkeeper","hitDice":"d8","hitDiceUsed":0,"saves":[],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","dec","his","itm","med","nat","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"int"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"7p78eooyEyF8LXNq":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.poHWQdLb44Dq42w8"},"cf":{"id":"temp_2yzu6binvby","path":"Classes#/CF_SEP/Subclasses#/CF_SEP/Necromancer","color":"#000000"}}}
